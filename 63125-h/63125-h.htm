<p class="first">
Three young men, the best of friends, a painter,
Bainbridge Breen, a writer, Eric Nielsen, and a
composer, John Carstairs, were arguing that three-faced
conundrum, morals. Quite an accident had
provoked them to it: a waitress, Erna Vitek. From
picking at her they had launched into axiomizing,
only to come back to her. Her morals were the vital
topic of the evening. Carstairs&rsquo; studio provided the
<em>mise en scène</em>.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ve hit a conclusion at last,&rdquo; said Breen
with an air of comfortable finality. &ldquo;Carstairs calls
her moral, I say she&rsquo;s unmoral, and Nielsen that she
may be moral, unmoral or even both.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now, we&rsquo;ve all conceded that Erna&rsquo;s not immoral&mdash;at
least she doesn&rsquo;t lead a life inconsistent
with morality?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very well then,&rdquo; Breen concluded contentedly.
&ldquo;Now let me make a proposition.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What kind of a proposition?&rdquo; Nielsen quizzed
<a id="page-6" class="pagenum" title="6"></a>
in droll tones and looked at Carstairs, who was
frowning.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s very little to it. I can dish it out in a
few words. It&rsquo;s simply this: that we put Erna to
the test.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; was Carstairs&rsquo; immediate
challenge.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry!&rdquo; Breen responded blandly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
not going to injure the girl.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, what did you mean&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Merely this,&rdquo; the painter interrupted quietly. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t believe that any of us know her very well.
She&rsquo;s only been working at Landsmann&rsquo;s a few
months. Of course, Carstairs, you&rsquo;ve taken her out
on one or two occasions, so you&rsquo;ve had an opportunity
of studying her at closer range.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not of studying her!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t study her, certainly. You&mdash;er&mdash;what
would you call it, Nielsen?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, John has been burned a little by the divine
flame.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Carstairs blushed angrily. &ldquo;If you fellows intend
to be personal&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Never mind, John,&rdquo; Nielsen cut in. &ldquo;You
must allow us the occasional escape of some of our
surplus wind. Now, let&rsquo;s drop these bravado poses
and get down to business. I want the rest of the
<a id="page-7" class="pagenum" title="7"></a>
proposition. We know that we&rsquo;re to put Erna to
the test. Now, Breen, tell us how.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing to explain. I said, put her to
the test. Let each one, in his own way and for himself,
perhaps, pay her attentions&mdash;I don&rsquo;t mean,
make love to her&mdash;but simply, well, let him take her
to the theatre or to supper some evening&mdash;she&rsquo;s free
nights&mdash;and find out how close he can get to her&mdash;I
don&rsquo;t mean seduction&mdash;but that he penetrate her
character. Let each, in his own way, learn for
himself, and later we&rsquo;ll compare notes and decide
whether the respected lady has the moral or the unmoral
tendency or even whether she might develop
an&mdash;er&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;See here, Breen!&rdquo; Carstairs exploded.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;d forgotten that we agreed to throw that
out,&rdquo; the painter apologized. &ldquo;You see, I couldn&rsquo;t
help thinking of that little affair with the young
prize ring gladiator. What was his name? Allen!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But that was only a temptation,&rdquo; Carstairs
fought back.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course, only a temptation. But we have
only her word that it never proved more.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The composer was ready with a hot retaliation
when Nielsen interposed: &ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s revert
to that topic again, Breen. We can never know the
whole story, and it only annoys John to refer to it.
<a id="page-8" class="pagenum" title="8"></a>
We know that Erna was down and out at the time&mdash;she&rsquo;d
just come to Landsmann&rsquo;s, was unsettled and
that sort of thing&mdash;that much we know and that
young Allen followed her there with an offer of
cash. At least, she intimated something like that to
John and said it was a case of being good or bad
then and there. She chose being good. Even if she
had chosen the other, the transaction might have
been an unmoral and not an immoral one, for she
was fond of Allen.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now never mind, Breen! We&rsquo;ve threshed that
out often enough. Erna didn&rsquo;t flop&mdash;in fact, she
showed Mr. Allen the door, hasn&rsquo;t seen him since
and&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But we have only <em>her</em> word for all that stuff.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All right. There&rsquo;s no other to contradict.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Breen, although silenced, was busy reflecting;
Carstairs&rsquo; ire was appeased. Nielsen concluded:
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s take up Breen&rsquo;s proposition, John, each in
his own way, whatever that may be, and then we&rsquo;ll
compare notes some day and settle the business.
After all, Erna&rsquo;s only a waitress; we needn&rsquo;t spend
more than an ordinary amount of excitement over
her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But she isn&rsquo;t a waitress. I tell you, she&rsquo;s a
woman.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-9" class="pagenum" title="9"></a>
&ldquo;All right, woman let her be,&rdquo; Nielsen conceded
gracefully. &ldquo;Now, we don&rsquo;t want to sit here throwing
words and phrases around all evening. We&rsquo;ve
been at it too long as it is. Why not put the matter
to a vote and then drop it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Breen, of course, votes that we put her to the
test. Will you vote that way too?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Carstairs gave in with an effort.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Fine!&rdquo; Nielsen applauded. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll vote &lsquo;yes&rsquo;
too.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Motion proposed and carried that one Erna
Vitek, employed as waitress at the Café Landsmann&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll do, Breen. We&rsquo;ve had enough of your
eloquence for one evening. You&rsquo;ve given me a
headache. Besides, I&rsquo;m sick of this subject. Let&rsquo;s
start something else.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Breen laughed his ever-ready, self-satisfied laugh,
and Nielsen, and even Carstairs, joined him. Presently,
the studio slept the sleep of the unperturbed.
Carefully, Breen filled his pipe and began a deliberate
puffing, while Nielsen introduced some new
anecdote in his droll, even-tempered way. Carstairs,
on the other hand, was meditating gloomily: in an
hour or so he would be due at that damnable hole,
the Phoenix Music Hall&mdash;where he earned his
<a id="page-10" class="pagenum" title="10"></a>
bread playing accompaniments. A second thought
cheered him not a little. He would still have time
to eat his supper at Landsmann&rsquo;s.

</h2>

</div>

<p class="first">
&ldquo;Erna! What is the matter with you? Another
cup of coffee for Mr. Nolan!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I know it. I ordered it an hour ago.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The stocky, middle-aged, stolid-faced German
stared at the handsome sensual girl of twenty, muttered
something, as she returned his critical stare
with a defiant one, and passed out of the kitchen into
the store.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is the matter with Erna to-day?&rdquo; he demanded
of his stocky, middle-aged, stolid-faced
wife, who stood behind the counter waiting on
customers.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This is the third time she has been <em>schnautzing</em>
me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, she has something on her mind,&rdquo; was the
woman&rsquo;s unconcerned reply.
</p>

<p>
The storekeeper was not satisfied. &ldquo;That <em>fellow</em>
must be to blame,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Who?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That Allen! He&rsquo;s been coming here again.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Has he?&rdquo; the woman returned with the same
unconcern. &ldquo;Let him come. What do you care?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-12" class="pagenum" title="12"></a>
Erna Vitek was in a morose humor. Her pugnacious
nose seemed more pugnacious than ever, and
even her mouth, usually so soft and yielding, appeared
hard this morning. And her brown eyes,
which could give you gentle glances one day and
repelling ones the next, were filled with ominous
signs. There was a good reason. She had just
overheard the other waitresses exchanging remarks
about her. This would not have been so bad if their
talk had been without foundation. But it was true:
she had been glad to see Jimmy Allen yesterday
noon and evening, when he came in&mdash;after an absence
of three months. He had stopped drinking.
He had been living and training in the country, so
that the old color had returned to his face and the
old light to his eyes. He looked stronger than ever,
more energetic and happier. Yes, he was to begin
fighting again&mdash;next week&mdash;but that had never been
his worst fault. The girls said that she still &ldquo;liked
him&rdquo; or that she would &ldquo;like him again.&rdquo; This
would not have been so bad if&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Gretchen and Mollie were small, mean, dirty.
They were always gossipping about her. And she
had given them her old dresses, old hats, encouragement,
advice. What a lot of gratitude women felt
toward you!
</p>

<p>
Her face cleared. A laughing, splendidly built
<a id="page-13" class="pagenum" title="13"></a>
young fellow was making his way through the store,
returning salutations. He stopped in the kitchen
long enough to barter laughing glances with Erna
and passed down the two steps into the dining room:
a small low one containing six tables&mdash;Erna&rsquo;s empire.
There, he received more greetings and one or
two short tributes on his return to the public eye.
The young athlete pulled off his coat and cap and
hung them on the wall. He flung himself into a
chair at an empty table and was soon at his ease.
</p>

<p>
Erna was a shrewd girl. She did not come to
take his order at once. First, she served another
patron. Then, she cleared away some dishes.
Finally, she came to Jimmy&rsquo;s table, but with a careless
air.
</p>

<p>
He gave her a frank look. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s the girl?&rdquo;
was his familiar greeting.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Pretty fair!&rdquo; she responded in cool tones. &ldquo;How
are you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Bully!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; she went on indifferently.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Gimme time to breathe!&rdquo; he protested, and tried
to stare into her face and to take her hand.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; she warned him and drew back.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, what the deuce&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Customers are waitin&rsquo;&mdash;&rdquo; she cut him short.
</p>

<p>
He gave the bill of fare a contemptuous glance.
<a id="page-14" class="pagenum" title="14"></a>
&ldquo;Bring me a soft boiled egg, toast an&rsquo; a glass o&rsquo;
milk.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She looked at him with sudden irritation, but
smiled, turned her back and left the room with
aggravating slowness.
</p>

<p>
Jimmy appeared angry, but one of the patrons
disturbed his mood with an admiring: &ldquo;On a diet,
Jimmy?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What night does it come off?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Next Tuesday.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How do you feel?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Jimmy expanded his chest, gave himself a solid
punch and answered: &ldquo;Great! Harder than a
rock!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Feel sorry for &lsquo;the Kid.&rsquo; How long are you
goin&rsquo; to let him stay?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, part o&rsquo; the second,&rdquo; was Jimmy&rsquo;s laughing
assurance.
</p>

<p>
A sigh of pleasure and envy escaped the patrons.
And they quickly announced their intention to be
present at the joyous butchery.
</p>

<p>
Erna came back. She pretended to wipe off the
neighboring table. Pretty soon, however, she was
at Jimmy&rsquo;s side.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the grouch?&rdquo; he asked confidentially.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nothin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-15" class="pagenum" title="15"></a>
&ldquo;Still sore at me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sore at somebody else?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He looked up at her anxiously, but Erna smiled;
her eyes softened and winked slyly. Jimmy,
who was always willing to laugh, laughed again.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re still the kiddo,&rdquo; he whispered.
</p>

<p>
Erna blushed and moved away.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Erna!&rdquo; he called.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Wait a moment!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She stayed away about two minutes and then returned
with Jimmy&rsquo;s order, which was overdue.
Three of the patrons, exchanging &ldquo;so longs!&rdquo; with
the prize-fighter, went out. Two remained, milkmen,
but they were fast asleep.
</p>

<p>
Erna set Jimmy&rsquo;s order before him. He tried to
catch her hand, but she was too quick. An irritable
grunt escaped him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; she taunted him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with <em>you</em>?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nothin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But she dropped her glance coquettishly. He
gave her face and figure an admiring look.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Erna,&rdquo; he said gently.
</p>

<p>
She looked at him for a shy instant.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I say, Erna,&rdquo; he repeated.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-16" class="pagenum" title="16"></a>
&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not sore?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sure?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You know what I mean?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He studied her. &ldquo;Then why do you treat me
this way&mdash;now?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She tried bold and bashful glances, turned her
head a little and said enigmatically &ldquo;Just because.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Just because what?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Just because.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He shook his head, but his ever-ready laugh came
to his assistance. &ldquo;Then you&rsquo;re not sore?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sure?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Even though&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then you like to treat me this way just&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Just because!&rdquo; she echoed and started to laugh.
</p>

<p>
He gave her an adoring glance and this time
caught her hand. She tried to pull it away, but his
grip was too powerful. He squeezed her hand.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-17" class="pagenum" title="17"></a>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she begged in pain.
</p>

<p>
He let go and smiled. She was not angry. Instead,
she placed her hand on his biceps. He raised
his forearm and imprisoned her hand. &ldquo;Oo-oo!&rdquo;
she sighed in happy homage, and her eyes shone.
</p>

<p>
Once more, he freed her hand. &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Terrible!&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;What&rsquo;ll happen to
the poor &lsquo;Kid&rsquo;?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Death!&rdquo; was his jovial rejoinder.
</p>

<p>
He caught her hand once more. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
she warned him. He let go as before, but she did
not withdraw it immediately.
</p>

<p>
His glance grew bolder and bolder, but he hesitated.
He busied himself with his breakfast for a
moment, shaking salt into his egg and stirring it with
a spoon. He looked up and hesitated again. Finally,
he began: &ldquo;Then it&rsquo;ll be all right to-night?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;To-night?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes. You said you&rsquo;d tell me to-day.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I know.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be all right?&rdquo; he pleaded.
</p>

<p>
She eyed him a moment, softened a little and
then gave in: &ldquo;But where can we go?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We can take in a show,&rdquo; he suggested.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A show?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-18" class="pagenum" title="18"></a>
&ldquo;Oh, Miner&rsquo;s, the Gran&rsquo; or a movie.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She meditated.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hurry up! Here come some customers.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She turned her head quickly, and then looked
back at him. &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; she whispered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Where&rsquo;ll I meet you?&rdquo; he demanded eagerly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;At the old corner&mdash;eight o&rsquo;clock!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He pressed her hand in hurried understanding, as
three young men entered the dining room. They
were Breen, Carstairs and Nielsen. Erna passed
them on her way out with a nervous &ldquo;good-morning.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She stayed out some time. Jimmy ate and drank
rapidly, got up, took his check, put on his cap and
coat, and ignoring the newcomers, left the room.
Breen and Nielsen had recognized him with amazement.
They watched him curiously, but not so Carstairs.
He sat there, staring gloomily at the table.
</p>

III
</h2>

</div>

<p class="first">
&ldquo;Moral or unmoral, but not&mdash;&rdquo; Breen started
and waited for Nielsen to supply the last word.
</p>

<p>
Nielsen, who understood, shook his head and corrected:
&ldquo;Moral or unmoral&mdash;no more,&rdquo; and smiled
confidently.
</p>

<p>
Carstairs looked from Nielsen to Breen and continued
staring at the table.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How do you account then for the recrudescence
of our young gladiator?&rdquo; Breen went on.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And what has that to do with Erna&rsquo;s life,
present or future?&rdquo; Nielsen argued amiably.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If he&rsquo;s calling again?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let him call! Does that necessarily affect
Erna&rsquo;s conduct?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But <em>hasn&rsquo;t</em> it affected her conduct? Didn&rsquo;t you
notice it as we came in?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Nielsen wore a thoughtful frown, but smiled mischievously
and declared: &ldquo;There was nothing <em>im</em>moral,
as far as I could make out.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Breen was gracious enough to agree: &ldquo;Perhaps
not.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-20" class="pagenum" title="20"></a>
They were silent. Carstairs watched them
gloomily and then returned to his occupation. Erna
came in, affecting a matter-of-fact air.
</p>

<p>
Breen and Nielsen pressed her with playful greetings
and compliments. She accepted them as part
of the tribute due her each day, but her stereotyped
expression disappeared, and she was ready to take
up her duties as gracious empress. Even her pugnacious
nose appeared less pugnacious. Having recognized
the young men&rsquo;s tribute by a favor or two,
she criticized genially: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re late this morning.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nielsen overslept himself,&rdquo; Breen explained.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you believe him&mdash;he overslept himself,&rdquo;
Nielsen retorted.
</p>

<p>
Erna was leaning against their table, her arms
akimbo. The pair received a glance each, as was
their due, and then she studied Carstairs. &ldquo;Maybe
it was you, Mr. Carstairs?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He looked up. &ldquo;Me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes&mdash;maybe it was you that overslept yourself.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Carstairs blushed, his friends laughed, and he
denied with a return of good nature: &ldquo;No. They
were the ones.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not awake yet, Erna,&rdquo; Breen fought back.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t look it,&rdquo; she seconded.
</p>

<p>
The young composer blushed again, but did not
<a id="page-21" class="pagenum" title="21"></a>
defend himself this time. Nielsen eyed him with
friendly concern.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Your orders, gentlemen.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your hurry?&rdquo; Breen complained.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t suppose I can stand here all day,&rdquo;
she reminded him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But I want to admire you a little,&rdquo; he protested.
&ldquo;Who wants to eat in the presence of a&mdash;of a&mdash;Why,
look at the beautiful red ribbon! Is it a new
one, Erna?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; and instantly, Erna, always susceptible
to praise or flattery, raised her hands to arrange the
ribbon.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It matches your hair to perfection,&rdquo; Breen pursued.
&ldquo;You love color, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Red the most?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Blood, blood red?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My favorite color, too!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; Nielsen interposed. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t steal
all the crumbs, Breen.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Erna laughed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But they belong to me,&rdquo; Breen defended himself.
&ldquo;Color is my line. Red is my color too.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-22" class="pagenum" title="22"></a>
&ldquo;These grasping conceited painters!&rdquo; Nielsen
grumbled.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Erna interceded. &ldquo;If he likes red, he
likes red.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;&rsquo;A second Daniel&rsquo;,&rdquo; quoted Breen. &ldquo;I thank
thee, gracious Lady. Thou and I are of one mind
and desire. By the way, Erna! Did you ever wear
all red?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No&mdash;oh, yes, two or three years ago.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You did? Have you still got the dress?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve outgrown it. I&rsquo;m&mdash;I&rsquo;m stouter now,&rdquo;
and she expanded her chest and laughed again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But you must find it,&rdquo; he continued with growing
interest. &ldquo;You could easily alter it to fit, couldn&rsquo;t
you? I want you to pose for me. You know you&rsquo;ve
promised me several times. Wouldn&rsquo;t you like to?
All in red: red ribbon, red waist, and skirt and even
red slippers, but best of all, red cheeks and red lips!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Erna&rsquo;s pleasure-loving scent was aroused.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Will you, Erna?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;When?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, not to-day.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;When then?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not to-morrow.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, pshaw&mdash;when then?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My first afternoon off?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-23" class="pagenum" title="23"></a>
&ldquo;Fine! When will that be?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Next Monday.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good! And you&rsquo;ll be ready?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, if you really want me to. But I won&rsquo;t be
able&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; he interrupted. &ldquo;Come anyhow!
You&rsquo;ll be immense just the same. You will
create&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Pooh, pooh, and likewise tut, tut!&rdquo; Nielsen
broke in. &ldquo;When are we to hear an end to this?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s jealous,&rdquo; said Erna.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Nielsen admitted. &ldquo;To the painter
go all the spoils. No one ever poses for a writer.
It wouldn&rsquo;t be proper.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; she challenged.
</p>

<p>
Nielsen got up in a hurry. &ldquo;What?&rdquo; he demanded
in mock seriousness.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Order, order!&rdquo; she said roguishly and looked
away.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Order, order!&rdquo; Breen echoed. &ldquo;The lady is
right. We must have order. Besides, we haven&rsquo;t
ordered.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Nielsen fell back with a philosophic sigh. &ldquo;All
is unfair when bad puns make their appearance.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It did not take the young men long to make their
choice of breakfast. Erna went away.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-24" class="pagenum" title="24"></a>
&ldquo;Come back soon!&rdquo; pleaded Breen.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;In a wink,&rdquo; she called back.
</p>

<p>
Breen started drumming on the table; Nielsen
looked across at him and hummed a pleasant tune.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a clever individual,&rdquo; he observed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to have her pose, old Sly Fox.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Certainly not, thou reader of souls.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I thought not.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m only carrying out our program of last
night. You seem to have forgotten it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then why criticize me for being the first one on
the job? It&rsquo;ll be up to you and Carstairs too.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Nielsen agreed jovially.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Count me out!&rdquo; Carstairs interrupted suddenly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The sleeper&rsquo;s awake,&rdquo; Breen applauded. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
back from the land of dreams. What news from
Arcadia, Colonel?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You can count me out,&rdquo; Carstairs repeated
stubbornly, and would not look at his friends.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; Nielsen interposed
sympathetically, and raised his hand to forewarn
Breen.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Breen&rsquo;s only been fooling all along!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I know.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-25" class="pagenum" title="25"></a>
&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;re not angry with him, or me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then what&rsquo;s the trouble?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like it&mdash;I hate it,&rdquo; the young composer
went on with difficulty.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What don&rsquo;t you like?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This business!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What, this business of testing Erna?&rdquo; Nielsen
asked gently, and studied him. &ldquo;John!&rdquo; The latter
refused to look at him. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all in fun. I thought
you were satisfied with our arrangement? We are
each to study Erna in our own way, then to compare
notes to learn whether&mdash;You don&rsquo;t have to
use Breen&rsquo;s method. I don&rsquo;t intend to. You don&rsquo;t
have to either.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I know.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then there ought to be no complaint.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Count me out anyhow.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Breen wanted to poke into the argument, but
Nielsen raised his hand again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not a waitress or a&mdash;or a working woman&mdash;or
a table or a chair,&rdquo; Carstairs said with obvious
difficulty.
</p>

<p>
Nielsen understood. He squeezed his neighbor&rsquo;s
arm and declared with his most soothing tone: &ldquo;She&rsquo;s
a woman, of course&mdash;as we concluded last night.
<a id="page-26" class="pagenum" title="26"></a>
Breen and I know that. You feel that we do, don&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Carstairs, who was in his most sentimental mood,
seemed on the verge of tears. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he managed
to agree.
</p>

<p>
Nielsen broke off the subject at once. &ldquo;Well,
we&rsquo;ll talk over the whole business some other time.
You&rsquo;re not feeling well this morning. It must be
your work at that confounded moving picture hole.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Carstairs said doubtfully.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Cheer up!&rdquo; Breen succeeded in interpolating.
&ldquo;Forget your troubles in the music world and listen
to that concert over there. That duet recital, I
should say.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Carstairs smiled.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tristan and Isolde are being undone,&rdquo; Nielsen
added, catching Breen&rsquo;s cue. &ldquo;Or Salome and
Jokannan, eh? Away with Wagner and Strauss:
Richard the First and Second&mdash;what do you say,
John?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The two milkmen, who were sleeping more
soundly than ever, appreciated their listeners&rsquo; applause.
They were indulging in a crescendo.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Silence and listen!&rdquo; Breen warned so solemnly
that Nielsen, and even Carstairs, laughed.
</p>

<p>
Breen and Nielsen exchanged nods. They had
<a id="page-27" class="pagenum" title="27"></a>
accomplished their object. Erna came back with
their orders.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What music have we here?&rdquo; Breen hailed her.
</p>

<p>
She set their orders on the table, and arranged
their plates, knives, forks and spoons. &ldquo;What did
you say?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What music is this emanating from yon Orpheus
and his Eurydice?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Must be some ragtime,&rdquo; she suggested.
</p>

<p>
Breen feigned disappointment.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It all depends upon one&rsquo;s taste, you see,&rdquo; Nielsen
interpreted for him.
</p>

<p>
And Carstairs laughed again.
</p>

<p>
Erna eyed him. &ldquo;Why, he&rsquo;s awake,&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Breen and Nielsen assured her.
</p>

<p>
Carstairs raised his head and met her glance for
an instant, and the sudden warmth he felt brought
color to his face. He looked elsewhere, but it was
plainly evident that he was feeling better.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure you&rsquo;re awake now?&rdquo; she questioned
wantonly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, thanks,&rdquo; he responded gratefully.
</p>

<p>
The young men started eating. Erna attended
to her remaining duties with them and then went
over to another table and sat down. Presently, she
was occupied folding paper napkins. Breen, with
Nielsen&rsquo;s assistance, opened a discussion on the newest
<a id="page-28" class="pagenum" title="28"></a>
fad of French painting, examples of which were
being exhibited at a Fifth Avenue gallery.
</p>

<p>
Carstairs stole cautious glances at Erna. Once
or twice, she raised her eyes and caught his glance
in hers. Both looked away in embarrassment. This
performance was repeated several times. There
seemed to be some shy understanding between them.
</p>

<p>
About a half hour later, the young men arose and
put on their hats and coats. Erna came over and
gave them their checks. &ldquo;So long, Erna,&rdquo; Nielsen
parted cordially. &ldquo;<em>Au midi</em>,&rdquo; Breen seconded.
And the pair made their way up the steps and out
of the dining room.
</p>

<p>
Carstairs had delayed his departure a moment.
He approached Erna nervously and in a hurried
voice, began: &ldquo;Is it all right for to-night? You
know, you were going to let me know.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She frowned a little and then returned: &ldquo;Yes&mdash;oh
no, I can&rsquo;t go out with you to-night.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
His face became tragic. She, possessed by one
of her soft moods, played the sympathetic: &ldquo;Will
you be off again this week?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes&mdash;Sunday night&mdash;from seven to nine,&rdquo; he
explained in an eager whisper.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; She waited, smiling.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Will it be all right then?&rdquo; he asked, his courage
rising.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-29" class="pagenum" title="29"></a>
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All right&mdash;Sunday&mdash;seven o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; he whispered,
hurried out&mdash;and forgot his check.
</p>

<p>
She came after him and caught him at the counter,
where he had joined his friends.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve forgotten your check,&rdquo; she told him,
with a bright glance.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, yes, thanks,&rdquo; he stammered.
</p>

<p>
Breen and Nielsen stared at him. The trio
passed out into the street.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Where shall we go?&rdquo; Breen questioned.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s bum a while in my room,&rdquo; Nielsen proposed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Carstairs declined.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why not, John?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I want to work a little,&rdquo; Carstairs explained.
</p>

<p>
Breen and Nielsen stared at him again.
</p>

<p>
Somewhat later, the painter and the writer were
comfortably seated in the latter&rsquo;s comfortable workshop.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I guess so, but I hope it isn&rsquo;t true,&rdquo; Nielsen was
saying.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;ll get over it. These attachments of his
are never serious nor of long duration. And at best,
she&rsquo;s only a hardened little thing, a fact he&rsquo;ll realize
in good season.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-30" class="pagenum" title="30"></a>
&ldquo;John was always much slower to learn matters
than the rest of us,&rdquo; Nielsen said dreamily.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s foolishly sensitive too.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And foolishly sentimental,&rdquo; Breen concluded.
</p>

<p>
There was a pause.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And how about your story?&rdquo; the painter continued.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;By the way, I&rsquo;m thinking of using Erna as a
model for&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Want her to pose for you too, old Sly Fox?&rdquo;
Breen demanded in revenge.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course, and incidentally to find out&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Breen interrupted, and the pair
laughed in mutual admiration.
</p>

<p>
In the meanwhile, John Carstairs was busy&mdash;working.
He was seated at the small upright piano,
which monopolized a good part of the space in his
small studio. About an hour later, he had finished
improvising and selecting and arranging his material
and now placed a large sheet of music paper against
the piano rack. The staves were blank at present,
but it was certain that the young composer intended
covering them as rapidly as possible. First of all,
however, he wrote the title of the composition at the

An evening performance was in full swing at the
Phoenix Music Hall, a small but well attended five
and ten cent moving picture and vaudeville establishment
on Eighth Avenue, not far from Landsmann&rsquo;s.
At present, the moving pictures were doing
a turn, and the auditorium was dark. Music
from a piano, placed close to the stage, was the only
accompaniment, but it was an adequate one. A
young, slender, anaemic individual was seated at
the piano.
</p>

<p>
At the moment, he was playing a dainty popular
waltz as a descriptive background for a French
comedy scene. Many a laugh rolled toward him.
Then he commenced a two-step, as the screen announced
a change of pictures. The audience
laughed more frequently and with heartier approval,
as an American farce romped by. Again, the
screen announced a change.
</p>

<p>
An Irish romance was under way. For this class
of sketch, Carstairs was expected to interpolate or
to improvise something &ldquo;sweet and dreamy.&rdquo; Therefore,
he took advantage of the opportunity. He
leaned closer to the keyboard, lowered his head and
<a id="page-32" class="pagenum" title="32"></a>
was soon engulfed in what he was rendering&mdash;so
much so, that he did not turn to keep in touch with
the pictures, as was his habit. The yearning sentimental
composition had made him captive.
</p>

<p>
Let others talk against Erna, he would still hold
fast to his faith in her. Breen was a cynic, and
Nielsen too. They flattered themselves that they
knew human nature, but they did not, for they were
lacking in sympathy. He had been foolish to listen
to their prattle concerning Erna. He would not do
so in the future. In fact, he ought to drop their acquaintance
or to avoid their company, at least. He
would do that. Now, he could keep his thought
of her, so pure, to himself&mdash;his thought of her, who,
in spite of her fun-loving and prank-playing nature,
was as pure as the purest and whitest of&mdash; Yes, he
would keep her pure. And Jimmy Allen, well, he
had come back, but his influence over her was dead,
dead since the day she had shown him the door, as
she had confided to him that time. He could trust
her. She was strong enough and pure enough to
take care of herself.
</p>

<p>
This was Friday; to-morrow would be Saturday,
and then Sunday, a long, long Sunday, would come
and have to pass before she would be with him. Of
course, he would see her to-morrow morning at breakfast,
but he must be careful to avoid the cynics.
<a id="page-33" class="pagenum" title="33"></a>
Even so, how could he tell her that he had composed
this for her, this, the best of his compositions, thanks
to the circumstance that she had been its inspiration.
Perhaps, it would be better not to tell her; it would
be a bigger surprise if he were to play it for her and
then offer it to her, as one would a flower or some
other symbol.
</p>

<p>
Would he have the courage to ask her to come to
his studio, so that he might play for her? And if
he had, suppose she should refuse? But she had
accepted an invitation from Breen, and only to pose
for him. Surely, she would not refuse him? And
if she did not, could he actually amuse and hold her
attention by merely playing for her? Why not?
She sang a great deal in the store,&mdash;it is true, popular
music, which he hated&mdash;but she had not been
educated to anything higher. That did not make
her any the less musical; moreover, she would learn
in time, at his guidance perhaps, since she possessed
so much temperament along with that lovely voice.
Therefore, she would not object should he offer to
play for her. And he would play as he never had
for any one, eventually to lead up to this composition,
that belonged so naturally to her. What
would she say when he would offer it to her as her
own? He must push his courage far enough to ask
her to come to his studio.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-34" class="pagenum" title="34"></a>
Carstairs continued playing and dreaming.
</p>

<p>
The audience was very still now. At one end
of the front row, a young couple were sitting, holding
hands. When the lights were up a while ago,
one might have recognized them as Erna Vitek and
Jimmy Allen. Both were living in the proverbial
seventh heaven.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t it lovely?&rdquo; she was whispering.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The two boobs in the love story?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not them so much&mdash;but the music!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Pretty good.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nice an&rsquo; dreamy, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes&mdash;sounds as though the guy was playing
for us.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Erna gave him a reproving nudge, and he
laughed. They listened and watched in silence.
But he grew impatient. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t care for the story,
do you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sure! What&rsquo;s the matter with it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Them two boobs gimme a pain.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I dunno.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re true to life?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So&rsquo;s my dead gran&rsquo;mother.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She laughed. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with &rsquo;em?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He squeezed her hand as gently as he was able.
&ldquo;Where do we come in?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-35" class="pagenum" title="35"></a>
&ldquo;What?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t we true to life?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She pulled her hand away.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; he demanded.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nothin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Gimme your&mdash;my hand again!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Just because.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sore?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He was silent.
</p>

<p>
Presently, she commanded: &ldquo;Jimmy!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
No answer.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Jimmy!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Again, no answer.
</p>

<p>
Her hand slid across his arm and sought his.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mad?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mm&mdash;no.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sure?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then why wouldn&rsquo;t you answer?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Just because!&rdquo; he mimicked her.
</p>

<p>
She slapped his hand gently, his hand opened and
they clasped again. There was a pause.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Erna,&rdquo; he said in bolder tones.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not so loud!&rdquo; she warned him.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-36" class="pagenum" title="36"></a>
&ldquo;Well then&mdash;Erna,&rdquo; he repeated in very low
tones.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s better.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How about it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;About what?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What I asked you &rsquo;fore we came here?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I asked you not to repeat that,&rdquo; was her reproach.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I know, but I can&rsquo;t help it. Don&rsquo;t you like it
here?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I mean here, side o&rsquo; me&mdash;in the dark?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well&mdash;&rdquo; He hesitated.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; she mocked him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Think o&rsquo; how swell it&rsquo;d be&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Be careful, Jimmy!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it,&rdquo; he persisted. &ldquo;Think o&rsquo; how
swell it&rsquo;d be&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Jimmy!&rdquo; she warned him once more.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh shucks!&rdquo; he returned aloud, and was silent.
There was a longer pause.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Jimmy!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
No answer.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Jimmy!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Again, no answer.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Jimmy!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-37" class="pagenum" title="37"></a>
A third time, no answer.
</p>

<p>
She pressed his hand and pushed against his
shoulder, but he would not respond. Erna gave in.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry&mdash;forgive me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mm&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you forgive me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say it very loud.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, you jumped on me before for talkin&rsquo;
loud.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;d wake the audience,&rdquo; she apologized.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he challenged.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well what?&rdquo; she retorted.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What did you want to say?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nothin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All right!&rdquo;&mdash;and he was silent.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah yes, Jimmy,&rdquo; she resigned.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You can go on with&mdash;with your story, but&mdash;but
don&rsquo;t go too far.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All right.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Promise?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then go ahead.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He revolved matters in his blunt mind, and recommenced:
&ldquo;You remember, I told you &rsquo;bout the&mdash;the
<a id="page-38" class="pagenum" title="38"></a>
little furnished flat my manager, Nolan, asked
me to move in?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, why couldn&rsquo;t we&mdash;just you an&rsquo; me&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Jimmy!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I know, but I can&rsquo;t help it, Erna. Things is
different now. When I asked you that time&mdash;well,
that&rsquo;s all over now. You an&rsquo; I&rsquo;s forgotten that. So
what&rsquo;s buried&rsquo;s buried. An&rsquo; times is different now.
You&rsquo;ve got a job, though it&rsquo;s a punk one. I&rsquo;ve got
a little money an&rsquo; more to come, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve cut drinkin&rsquo;.
My health&rsquo;s fine an&rsquo; prospects great. After I finish
&lsquo;the Kid&rsquo; there&rsquo;ll be Young Walcott&mdash;an&rsquo; after
Walcott, a bunch o&rsquo; others&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But Jimmy&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t butt in!&rdquo; he begged seriously. &ldquo;Now,
I know you hate that job o&rsquo; yours&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t all cheese an&rsquo; honey,&rdquo; she confessed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, an&rsquo; it never will be. Now, why can&rsquo;t you
pull up stakes&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Jimmy!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t butt in!&rdquo; he begged more seriously. &ldquo;This
is different than last time. I&rsquo;m a&mdash;a respectable
man now an&rsquo; you&rsquo;re a respectable woman.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Always have been,&rdquo; she cautioned him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; he hastened to admit. &ldquo;What I&rsquo;ve
been tryin&rsquo; to say is: Keep your job a little longer
<a id="page-39" class="pagenum" title="39"></a>
if you want to, till I go on with mine an&rsquo; get lots o&rsquo;
dough. In the meanwhile&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; she ventured, but with an ominous inflection.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll rent the little flat off Nolan, an&rsquo; you an&rsquo; I
can&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Jimmy!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m askin&rsquo; you to <em>marry</em> me this time,&rdquo; he
protested.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I know.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t that different?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Because it ain&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Because it ain&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But Erna&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now listen, Jimmy! You promised not to go
too far.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh shucks!&rdquo; he broke out.
</p>

<p>
They were silent. He let go her hand and drew
away a short distance. She removed her hand
rather reluctantly. Once or twice, she pushed
against his shoulder. But he would not respond.
</p>

<p>
The romantic pictures disappeared, and the music
ceased. The lights were turned on. There was a
sigh throughout the audience. Erna and Jimmy
<a id="page-40" class="pagenum" title="40"></a>
seemed glad of the change as well. A little sooner,
they would have been sorry.
</p>

<p>
She glanced his way. He was not looking in her
direction. She nudged him. He still refused to
turn his head. &ldquo;Jimmy,&rdquo; she whispered tenderly.
</p>

<p>
He stole a half glance at her. She was smiling
in invitation. He could not help smiling too.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You all right now?&rdquo; she ventured.
</p>

<p>
He turned toward her, and instantly, his ever-ready
laugh dispelled their gloom.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You all right?&rdquo; she repeated.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he admitted, and declared: &ldquo;Some scrap
that!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, it wasn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she reassured him and smiled
with revived mischief.
</p>

<p>
Their hands fell back to their natural occupation.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Turn out the lights!&rdquo; Jimmy commanded in so
loud a tone that most of their neighbors, as well as
Erna, giggled.
</p>

<p>
A German comedian made his appearance and
offered the usual monologue. No musical accompaniment
was required for this act; therefore, Carstairs
had disappeared under the stage. He had not
seen Erna and Jimmy, nor they him.
</p>

</h2>

</div>

<p class="first">
Carstairs was waiting at the street corner rendezvous
early the following Sunday evening. Impatience
had kept him company all day, a long day,
but the impatience he felt now was even keener. He
had been ahead of their appointment by about
twenty minutes, for he was afraid that Erna might be
there first. His vigil was that much the longer and
more trying. What hours it took for minutes to
pass! Suppose she did not come?
</p>

<p>
The fates, however, were good-humored. He
could see an athletic figure coming along at a
familiar leisurely pace. It was Erna. His joy and
excitement were such that he could scarcely wait
for her to reach him. What made her walk so
slowly?
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; was her soft cheery greeting.
</p>

<p>
He had avoided the bakery restaurant all day.
He could hardly return her salutation, the last of
his courage having fled.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Where&mdash;where shall we go?&rdquo; he questioned.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Anywhere,&rdquo; she agreed genially.
</p>

<p>
Now was his opportunity. He must ask her. Of
course, they could not walk the streets the whole of
<a id="page-42" class="pagenum" title="42"></a>
his two hours&rsquo; freedom. Nor could they go to the
theatre so early. Would she sense these arguments?
Moreover, they had been to a restaurant for a little
refreshment and conversation on their two former
outings. She had not enjoyed those visits particularly,
reminding her, as they must have, of her daily
life at Landsmann&rsquo;s.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a little bit too cold,&rdquo; he ventured.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not so very,&rdquo; she returned mischievously, as
they started walking.
</p>

<p>
He was frightened. &ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She was enjoying his embarrassment, but came to
his assistance with: &ldquo;Well, where <em>shall</em> we go? It&rsquo;s
up to you. You did the invitin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got nearly two hours,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;Can
you stay out that long?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m off for the rest o&rsquo; the night,&rdquo; she assured him;
&ldquo;but I ought to be back under the quilt by ten. I&rsquo;m
a bit tired.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course, you are,&rdquo; he agreed hurriedly&mdash;this
was another opportunity&mdash;&ldquo;so we mustn&rsquo;t do any
walking. Do you&mdash;would you like to come&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How would you like to come over to my place?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was out. What would she say?
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Will anybody else be there?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh no!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-43" class="pagenum" title="43"></a>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s over there on Fourteenth Street somewhere,
ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
Joy and excitement overwhelmed him. He could
not speak. And he had imagined all along that it
would be so difficult to induce her to come. He did
not know what to say.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do we cross here?&rdquo; she suggested.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said in a low tone.
</p>

<p>
The need of politeness forced itself upon him.
Timidly, he took her arm and led her across the
street. As a matter of fact, it was she, who was so
much stronger and more daring than he, who had
done the leading. They reached the opposite side,
and walked along in silence. After a minute or so,
they approached an old building.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Here it is,&rdquo; he declared nervously and let go her
arm.
</p>

<p>
They climbed three smelly flights of stairs, followed
a dark hallway and came to a halt. He took
out his keys and opened a door. &ldquo;Step in,&rdquo; he
requested.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got the light lit,&rdquo; she announced.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I thought it&rsquo;d be&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s awful nice here.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you think so?&rdquo; he questioned eagerly, greatly
<a id="page-44" class="pagenum" title="44"></a>
encouraged. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s such a small, dingy place.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; she maintained. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nice an&rsquo; cosy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Erna walked about, examining articles with her
inquisitive eyes. &ldquo;So this is your piano?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s an old box.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s nice lookin&rsquo;. An&rsquo; whose picture is
that?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My mother&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;An&rsquo; that one?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh that&mdash;that&rsquo;s only&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;An old <em>friend</em>?&rdquo; she assisted him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he agreed, and his blushes appeared.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately, Erna&rsquo;s back was turned. But she
knew he was blushing, and her face lighted with
pleasure. She examined other articles.
</p>

<p>
Carstairs asked quickly: &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you take off
your things?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Slowly, she removed her coat and hat, and fixed
her hair at a small looking glass. &ldquo;Men use these
things too,&rdquo; she observed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, we do,&rdquo; he echoed, and put her things on
the couch, where he likewise laid his own.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; he advised.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Over here?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, this is a nice soft chair.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Carstairs walked about a while. He was so
<a id="page-45" class="pagenum" title="45"></a>
nervous that he did not know what to do. Nevertheless,
he realized that he must offer to entertain
her. At least, he must say something.
</p>

<p>
But Erna spoke first. &ldquo;What makes you walk
around?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh nothing,&rdquo; he returned abruptly, looked about
in confusion and finally selected the piano stool,
which, however, was so close to Erna&rsquo;s chair that his
confusion grew. The girl, herself, had betrayed a
little embarrassment once or twice, but she had conquered
its last sign. This was perhaps possible because
of her enjoyment of Carstairs&rsquo; rather pathetic
condition. Erna loved and craved praise or flattery,
and the young composer&rsquo;s substitute for them was
certainly a decided tribute.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s awful nice here,&rdquo; she repeated.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you think so,&rdquo; he responded gratefully,
and glanced toward her, only to look away.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s kind o&rsquo; restful too.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
This was an excellent opening.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You must be very tired,&rdquo; he declared.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A little bit.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been working all day?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Since six-thirty this morning.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Lord, then you must be tired.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not so very much,&rdquo; she denied with pride. &ldquo;I
can stand work.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-46" class="pagenum" title="46"></a>
He dared a glance at her strong body and her bold
eyes. How splendid she was!
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But <em>you</em> must be tired,&rdquo; she continued.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&mdash;no, only a very little.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been workin&rsquo; all day too.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;At the afternoon performance. I didn&rsquo;t get
away until six o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;An&rsquo; you go on to-night?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;From nine to eleven, yes,&rdquo; he explained, and
felt ashamed that he was so weary. And she had
been working in that stuffy, unhealthy dining room
and kitchen since half-past six and was as cheerful
as ever.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be needin&rsquo; a rest now,&rdquo; she went on.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh no!&rdquo; he hastily assured her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then will you play for me? I never heard you
play, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve heard Mr. Breen an&rsquo; Mr. Nielsen talk
so much about you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They are flatterers,&rdquo; he said, with a self-conscious
laugh. &ldquo;But if you&rsquo;d like&mdash;if you&mdash;would
you really like to have me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
This was his next opportunity, but again, his
courage would not assist him. What should he play?
&ldquo;Do you really feel like listening?&rdquo; he began once
more.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course&mdash;I like music,&rdquo; she argued.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-47" class="pagenum" title="47"></a>
There was nothing else to do. He had better start
playing. And Carstairs turned on the stool. &ldquo;What
shall I play for you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Anything at all.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But wouldn&rsquo;t you rather&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Play somethin&rsquo; you like yourself,&rdquo; she interrupted.
</p>

<p>
Carstairs hesitated. He had not had the faintest
idea how difficult it would be. Moreover, he could
feel her soft brown eyes resting on him. And he had
been vowing such wonderful deeds of late: that he
would play for her as he never had for any one&mdash;that
he would play her composition, which belonged
so naturally to her. Instead, he could scarcely touch
a key.
</p>

<p>
A spirit of self-condemnation took possession of
him. He must forget himself. She would think him
a fool. Besides, she might learn how much he&mdash;No,
she must not learn that. He commenced improvising.
</p>

<p>
The young composer blundered considerably at
first, but his self-resentment helped him, and his efforts
soon displayed more coherence and warmth.
Should he open his program with &ldquo;To Thee&rdquo;? Why
not? Why wait until later? But she might understand.
She might catch its significance and then&mdash;But
how could she know that he had written the
<a id="page-48" class="pagenum" title="48"></a>
composition? It might just as easily belong to some
other composer. Yes, he would play it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Are you ready?&rdquo; he asked with attempted
levity.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course, don&rsquo;t stop!&rdquo; she encouraged him.
</p>

<p>
Carstairs played &ldquo;To Thee&rdquo;, at first, with timidity
and uncertainty, but by and by with more resolution
and consequent expressiveness as his faith in the composition,
as an expression of himself, returned.
Gradually, too, he realized how appropriate was
the mood that flowed through its measures.
</p>

<p>
Erna watched him. A greedy little smile played
about the corners of her mouth and her nose twitched
slightly. But the corners straightened and her nose
stopped twitching.
</p>

<p>
No, he was too soft. His shoulders were so weak
and his hands so small and his face so pale&mdash;just
like his nature. He belonged to his mother up there
and to that soft pretty face over there. But he was
a nice, decent fellow. And he was lots of fun, he
was so different from other men. But he was sad.
She loved joy and freedom. He seemed like a mean
little prisoner, and he made her feel soft too. But he
had always been decent toward her. Yes, he belonged
to such as his mother and the pretty face.
Anyhow, he knew how to play the piano.... What
a different time she had had last night! Jimmy was
<a id="page-49" class="pagenum" title="49"></a>
such a big, strong, happy fellow. But even he did
not quite satisfy her. Erna sighed just a little.
</p>

<p>
She regained immediate control of herself and
stopped studying Carstairs. Instead, she followed
the patterns in the small rug at her feet. Presently,
she gave herself up to the music. It was very pretty.
It sounded familiar too.
</p>

<p>
Carstairs finished playing.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I like that,&rdquo; she said instantly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you?&rdquo; he demanded, wheeling toward her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s awful nice,&rdquo; she complimented him.
</p>

<p>
He brightened perceptibly. &ldquo;Do you really
think so? Do you really like it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He could not repress his emotion. &ldquo;Do you&mdash;I&mdash;what
do you think?&rdquo; he asked with enthusiasm.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you know who wrote that?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wrote that,&rdquo; he broke out, and leaned forward.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You did?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s awful nice,&rdquo; she repeated.
</p>

<p>
This was not very strong applause, but it was
more than sufficient for Carstairs, and he grew reckless.
In one moment, he had confessed himself the
<a id="page-50" class="pagenum" title="50"></a>
author of the work, and in the next, such was his
present rashness, he was about to go much farther.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How would you like&mdash;&rdquo; but he stopped, and
smiled in a happy way.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What?&rdquo; she urged him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure you like it?&rdquo; he repeated.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Would you like to have it?&rdquo; he asked with sudden
boldness.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you understand?&rdquo; he rambled on, and
explained: &ldquo;Composers, you know, write songs and
piano pieces and orchestral works, and afterward
they often dedicate them to somebody&mdash;to one of
their friends or&mdash;or one of their relatives. Do you
understand?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I want to do,&rdquo; he continued excitedly.
&ldquo;I wrote the piece&mdash;it&rsquo;s nothing wonderful,
but I&mdash;I put myself into it and&mdash;and you like it&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So I&rsquo;d like to give it to you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t play,&rdquo; she protested.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t the point,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m dedicating
it to you&mdash;that is, your name appears on it:
first, the name of the composition, then my name, as
<a id="page-51" class="pagenum" title="51"></a>
composer, and then &lsquo;to Miss Erna Vitek.&rsquo; Do you
see?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh yes!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you like the idea?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s fine.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Great!&rdquo; he cried.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But what&rsquo;s the name o&rsquo; the piece?&rdquo; she requested
quietly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, I&mdash;I gave it a name&mdash;but suppose I call
it simply: &lsquo;A Song&rsquo;?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sure! That&rsquo;d be a nice title, wouldn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
His emotions threatened to run over. He wanted
to tell her the rest: that, as a matter of fact, she had
been the one to inspire the composition&mdash;his inspiration&mdash;but,
well, that would be going too far. She
would be learning too much. But this was the happiest
day of his life. He had made a long stride,
even over the evening when, for a few confidential
minutes, she had confided to him those details of her
past relation with Allen. He must compose many
compositions for her.
</p>

<p>
Carstairs played other music, composition after
composition, many of them his own, but all the while
he waited to hear Erna ask him to repeat her composition.
She did not do so at once, but eventually,
<a id="page-52" class="pagenum" title="52"></a>
bored&mdash;to tell the truth&mdash;by the incessant flow of
music, she made the request. Overjoyed, he repeated
the work, and every measure lingered,
breathed and swayed with the mood of its creator.
Near the close, Erna succeeded in stifling a yawn.
</p>

<p>
It was after nine o&rsquo;clock when Carstairs conducted
her down the three flights. He would receive a
reprimand and fine when he reported at the music
hall. But what did he care?
</p>

<p>
The young composer did not return to his sanctum
until eleven thirty. He quickly lit the gas. At the
theatre, a thought had come to torment him, as he
had rehearsed the evening&rsquo;s doings and joys many
times over. He went to the piano and took down
the picture of the girl. Presently, he buried it under
a heap of odds and ends that littered the drawer of
a bureau, and said to himself for at least the fiftieth
time: &ldquo;What a careless damned fool I am!&rdquo;
</p>

VI
</h2>

</div>

<p class="first">
It was early the next afternoon. Breen and Nielsen
were arguing in the former&rsquo;s studio: a large unusually
well furnished and attractively decorated
West Fourteenth Street skylight room.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now, you clear out of here!&rdquo; Breen was commanding.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be here right away.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sure she won&rsquo;t disappoint thee?&rdquo; Nielsen
mocked pleasantly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, I saw her this morning and this noon for a
moment, and she intends keeping her royal promise.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How about the rouge garment?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She hasn&rsquo;t had time to alter it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That won&rsquo;t make any difference, of course,&rdquo;
Nielsen ventured in provoking tones.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Go on! Clear out of here!&rdquo; Breen repeated.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You painters!&rdquo; sang Nielsen, as he backed toward
the door.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re no worse than you fellows are,&rdquo; Breen
retorted. &ldquo;Besides, this afternoon is no more and
no less than an experiment in line with the contract
of our triumvirate. Your inning will come, especially
as you are writing a story, for which purpose&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-54" class="pagenum" title="54"></a>
&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Nielsen admitted with cheerful slyness.
&ldquo;And I really need Erna to help me with it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And Carstairs will have to contribute his share
of the contract, unless he persists in that &lsquo;count me
out&rsquo; air of his.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;ll come around, in his own way,&rdquo; was
Nielsen&rsquo;s confident assurance. &ldquo;I saw him this
morning, by the way&mdash;the first time I&rsquo;ve seen him at
Landsmann&rsquo;s in several days.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How is he?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Unusually cheery and affable.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll recover from that foolishness.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think so too, but&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now, get out!&rdquo; Breen commanded a third time.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be gossipping here forever.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Nielsen took hold of the door knob, smiled in an
aggravating manner, opened the door, bowed low
and said in a droll tone: &ldquo;Moral or unmoral,
but&mdash;?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Breen followed him, but Nielsen escaped, and the
painter slammed the door. His mood changed instantly.
He bustled around the studio, fixing this
and rearranging that object and eventually looked
about with satisfaction. He then approached a looking
glass, readjusted his tie, smoothed his hair with
his hand and otherwise subjected himself to a critical
but self-satisfied examination, which, however, was
<a id="page-55" class="pagenum" title="55"></a>
cut short by a knock at the door. He hurried over
to the door and opened it. &ldquo;Come in!&rdquo; he said
cordially and stepped aside for Erna.
</p>

<p>
She was wearing her best clothes, which were
very attractive on her. Unfortunately, the only red
in the picture was a profusion of ribbons on her black
hat and a neat tie&mdash;but fortunately, her red cheeks
and lips were not missing. Altogether, Erna was a
seductive apparition.
</p>

<p>
Certainly, this was Breen&rsquo;s opinion too. &ldquo;How
charming you look, your Ladyship!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do I?&rdquo; she retorted, smiling.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh decidedly, decidedly,&rdquo; and Breen bowed in
anticipation of a pleasant afternoon. Bringing all of
his courtesy to the surface, he helped Erna to remove
her coat. She went over to the looking glass,
laughed, cried: &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got a glass too,&rdquo; and took
off her hat with careless ease.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; demanded Breen, standing
behind her and surveying her reflection with open
admiration.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nothin&rsquo;,&rdquo; she returned rather impudently.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A lovely girl that!&rdquo; he added significantly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Think so?&rdquo; she challenged.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Decidedly,&rdquo; he repeated.
</p>

<p>
She shrugged her shoulders a little and smiled at
him in the glass. Breen&rsquo;s interest grew. He tried
<a id="page-56" class="pagenum" title="56"></a>
to put his hands on her shoulders, by way of confidence,
but Erna turned toward him with a quick
supple movement. Like the accomplished artist she
was, she said nothing, not even by way of reproach,
but laughed again. He eyed her with still franker
admiration.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; she questioned.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I know,&rdquo; he said, recollecting his rôle, and
went on evasively: &ldquo;But you&rsquo;re not wearing your
red dress or very much red?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What difference does that make? Maybe you&rsquo;d
rather have me come some other time?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, no! You stay right here, now that you&rsquo;ve
come. You&rsquo;ll do just as well in that costume. The
same Erna Vitek is inside it. But&mdash;er&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But what?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t attempt a color sketch of you in that
dress. There, there, forgive me&mdash;it&rsquo;s very charming,
my dear, but&mdash; Perhaps, I&rsquo;ll just make a pencil
sketch of you to-day. Artists ought to commence
with pencil sketches anyhow, until the characters of
their subjects have had time to properly enter their
blood, so to speak. Which, of course, is all Greek
to you. Do you object, madame?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, do me any way you like,&rdquo; she consented.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, if you feel that way about it,&rdquo; he hinted
audaciously.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-57" class="pagenum" title="57"></a>
&ldquo;Take care!&rdquo; she warned.
</p>

<p>
Breen went over to the model throne and pretended
to place the chair for her. He was sorry
that he had had to suggest even a pencil sketch of
her, but he was forced to attempt some part of their
original agreement. What is more, he had practically
cast away all thought of &ldquo;studying&rdquo; Erna,
later to make his report before the triumvirate. She
was too interesting and magnetic an individual to be
used for such a childish purpose. &ldquo;Come over here
and sit down,&rdquo; he requested calmly.
</p>

<p>
Giving herself an unexpected air of modesty, she
complied, at the same time adding a prudish touch
by fixing her skirt carefully as she sat down. Breen
was puzzled, but drew up a chair, took a pencil and
sketch book and seated himself. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going ta draw
you at close range,&rdquo; he apologized. She smiled in
encouragement.
</p>

<p>
Breen commenced drawing, very carelessly, it is
true. Erna watched him with innocent eyes. &ldquo;Do
I pose right?&rdquo; she asked at length.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he assured her.
</p>

<p>
She was silent.
</p>

<p>
A little later, she asked: &ldquo;Do your models have
to keep quiet?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not at all! Chatter away!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But she preferred to remain silent. To tell the
<a id="page-58" class="pagenum" title="58"></a>
truth, this was not Erna&rsquo;s first experience as a sitter.
She had posed for two or three other artists in the
past: once as Carmen, another time as a madonna,
and a third time for some allegorical effort concerning
Spring. Breen continued to study her for the
drawing. His mind, however, or that region wherein
its desires lay, was more busy than his pencil. Ten
minutes or so later, he stopped drawing and held the
pad off, squinted one eye at Erna, then at the drawing
and again at Erna.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you like being winked at?&rdquo; he asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Depends upon who&rsquo;s doin&rsquo; it,&rdquo; she commented.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you like me to do it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she replied enigmatically.
</p>

<p>
He got up from his chair and approached her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Bring the picture with you!&rdquo; she requested.
</p>

<p>
Breen, however, once more tried to put his hands
on her. She pushed back her chair, and in outraged
tones commanded: &ldquo;Mr. Breen!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; he said with well assumed
candor, but he was irritated to a considerable degree.
&ldquo;I merely wanted to change your pose a bit.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, why didn&rsquo;t you ask <em>me</em> to do it?&rdquo; she
complained, her innocent self again.
</p>

<p>
He returned to his chair without explaining.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Am I all right now?&rdquo; she asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Pull your chair forward again.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-59" class="pagenum" title="59"></a>
&ldquo;So?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll do.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Erna watched him as before, and Breen went on
drawing. But his usually well balanced mind was
ruffled. He tried to construct some other scheme.
Erna had always been quite prone (after all, she
was only a waitress) to permit occasional familiarity
on his part at Landsmann&rsquo;s. What made her play
the prude away from home? Perhaps she was, at
heart, like the rest of her class, nothing more than a
narrow moralistic thing, and not the unmoral soul
he had constantly given her credit for being. His
disgust was supreme. On the contrary, he mused,
she might only be playing a part. Admitting that
Erna, in society, only held the position of waitress,
still, she was a very shrewd girl. He must try some
other attack, allowing her the credit she deserved.
He had attempted flattery, pleasantry and not a little
boldness. What should be his next step?
</p>

<p>
Eventually, the young artist tried bribery. Having
finished his work, he presented it to Erna accompanied
by a short but eloquently complimentary
speech. The girl did not neglect to admire the
drawing and to thank him for the present. His act,
apparently, made no stronger impression on her.
Later, he suggested and, with her consent, prepared
and served some tea and biscuits. They were sitting
<a id="page-60" class="pagenum" title="60"></a>
at a small cosy table. About them, the atmosphere
had spread a halo of warmth and intimacy. And
Breen played host and admirer to the best of his
accomplished ability. But Erna refused to respond
any more than she had done earlier. She appeared
grateful; she talked a good deal; and she seemed
completely at ease with Breen and her surroundings.
But she would not respond more than she had done.
Breen&rsquo;s disgust threatened to reach a climax.
</p>

<p>
There was a reason for Erna&rsquo;s conduct. She, in
her greed of heart, playing with Breen, as she had
with Carstairs, the part of a watchful cat, had come
to several conclusions. She disliked the artist&rsquo;s long,
angular figure, his sharp, shrewd face, and most of
all, his cold, self-sympathetic eyes. And she disliked
him personally even more. Without claiming
any undue powers of discernment for Erna, one
would surely have had to credit her with the possession
of a strong feminine instinct. Her instinct had
resented his attentions, for, behind them all, she had
felt that he, as a gentleman, was shoving her down
where she belonged. She was a waitress, but she
was good looking enough and lots of fun for him&mdash;and
much more in prospect. In a word, Breen had
brought out the hard calculating side of her nature,
and she had raised her guard against him.
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, Erna was in a bad humor when she
<a id="page-61" class="pagenum" title="61"></a>
came to Breen&rsquo;s studio, her genial conduct notwithstanding.
She had seen Jimmy that noon in the dining
room, but he had spent all of his time talking
fight with the customers. As though the fact that
he was to turn to the ring to-morrow night would
bring the world to an end! She would pay him for
neglecting her. Besides, Mr. Nielsen had been approaching
her. He had been asking her to &ldquo;pose&rdquo;
for him too. Did he also want to take advantage
of her? Still, there was something human inside of
him. He had always acted a little differently from
the others. As for Jimmy&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Breen interrupted her reflection. He reached
across the table and tried to touch her hand. Erna&rsquo;s
face flushed with anger, and her hand came down
upon his with a loud slap. Just as quickly, she recollected
herself. &ldquo;Excuse me!&rdquo; she asked sullenly.
</p>

<p>
Breen, however, was through. He arose from his
chair. This had been impudence beyond all impudence.
And the man of success turned his back
upon the waitress.
</p>

<p>
Erna likewise got up, leaving the sketch on the
table. She did not offer a second apology. Instead,
she drew on her coat, picked up her hat and walked
over to the glass. Her face was crimson.
</p>

<p>
Breen was quite sorry. He came behind Erna
and made several attempts to clear some momentary
<a id="page-62" class="pagenum" title="62"></a>
pangs of conscience. But Erna would not listen.
He moved away, pride clouding his face.
</p>

<p>
Erna hurried toward the door. Breen followed
her, offering one or two final excuses. But she
refused to answer, and went out. Breen slammed
the door behind her. Presently, he was busy pacing
the studio in a vain endeavor to regain some of his
composure.
</p>

<p>
Steps were to be heard coming along the hallway.
The door was opened cautiously, and Nielsen&rsquo;s head
and shoulders appeared. And his caressing voice
questioned: &ldquo;Well, your Highness, what is your
decision? Moral, unmoral or&mdash;?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Breen faced about, swore a strong oath and commanded:
&ldquo;Get out of here!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But, dear Bainbridge&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Get out, you spy!&rdquo; Breen continued angrily, and
went toward the door.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But I want to know your decision.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Moral, moral, a million times moral&mdash;she has
degenerated&mdash;in fact, she hasn&rsquo;t even degenerated.
I wouldn&rsquo;t do her the honor of saying so. She&rsquo;s always
been a narrow, conventional, contemptible little
thing. Is that enough, you ass? She&rsquo;s a&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Enough, noble Sire!&rdquo; Nielsen interrupted with a
mysterious air. &ldquo;Thou hast spoken. Enough!&rdquo;
<a id="page-63" class="pagenum" title="63"></a>
Luckily, his head and shoulders disappeared just in
time.
</p>

<p>
Breen slammed the door.

VII
</h2>

</div>

<p class="first">
Wednesday morning was a particularly noisy
morning in the rear dining room of Landsmann&rsquo;s.
Jimmy Allen was the hero. On the night before, he
had knocked out his opponent toward the close of
the first round. Some of his admirers had met at
Landsmann&rsquo;s to discuss and celebrate the event, and
one who had been present was supplying the others
with the details.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;An&rsquo; toward the end o&rsquo; the round,&rdquo; he was describing,
&ldquo;Jimmy ducked under the poor &lsquo;Kid&rsquo;s&rsquo;
flabby guard an&rsquo; caught &rsquo;im an awful soak in the
guts, an&rsquo; as &lsquo;the Kid&rsquo; doubled up, Jimmy swung the
finisher&mdash;it was a terror!&mdash;right on the point o&rsquo;
the jaw. &lsquo;The Kid&rsquo; hit the mat deader than a door
nail. An&rsquo; they carried &rsquo;im away, a smashed hope
inside o&rsquo; three minutes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The listeners clamored for more, and one of them
queried: &ldquo;But I thought &lsquo;the Kid&rsquo; was such a clever
sidestepper?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He is, but he couldn&rsquo;t sidestep Jimmy. Jimmy&rsquo;s
a terror in the ring. He&rsquo;s a good-natured feller outside,
but the sight of another feller in front of &rsquo;im
kind o&rsquo; riles &rsquo;is blood. He can&rsquo;t rest till he&rsquo;s battered
<a id="page-65" class="pagenum" title="65"></a>
the guy away, an&rsquo; let &rsquo;im see a little blood,
like &lsquo;the Kid&rsquo;s&rsquo; mouth bleedin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s all off &rsquo;cept
the count, for Jimmy goes wild. He got to &lsquo;the Kid&rsquo;
by constant borein&rsquo; in. Half a dozen fierce body
taps weakened the poor guy, then a couple o&rsquo; face
smashers, an&rsquo; then the finish. Oh, it was awful.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The listeners sighed with awe. &ldquo;An&rsquo; Jimmy?&rdquo;
requested the interlocutor.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, he got a scratch or two. But he was &rsquo;is
smilin&rsquo; self soon&rsquo;s it was over.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Standing near the doorway, listening to every
word with feverish interest, was Erna. Her eyes
shone, and her heart beat with joyous pride.
</p>

<p>
Landsmann suddenly called to her from the
kitchen: &ldquo;Erna, your order is here.&rdquo; She did not
heed him, but waited for more details. Again, the
storekeeper called to her, but once more, she refused
to heed him. The man appeared in the doorway,
his face red with vexation. &ldquo;Erna! Do you hear
me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; she retorted petulantly, and hurried
past him. He followed close behind her, and as she
turned, gave her a stupid but indignant stare. Erna
returned his stare with interest, and Landsmann,
beaten as he had been so often, retreated to the store,
there to seek muttered consultation with his wife.
</p>

<p>
Erna was about to take up her order, when she
<a id="page-66" class="pagenum" title="66"></a>
came upon a remarkable sight. She stopped, stared
and, stimulated by a desire to emulate, tiptoed forward,
her strong white teeth showing in the joy of
anticipation. On the bottom of the kitchen sink, a
goodly sized rat was drinking.
</p>

<p>
The girl continued to sneak forward without making
a sound. Suddenly, her hand darted out and
seized the rat by the neck; at the same time, she
turned on the water from the large faucet. With a
strong grip, she held the squirming, squeaking animal
under the stream.
</p>

<p>
Gretchen screamed and ran out into the store.
&ldquo;<em>Was ist los?</em>&rdquo; demanded the storekeeper. Gretchen
told her story in a frightened whisper. Mrs.
Landsmann and Molly screamed; several customers
arose and, led by Landsmann, who waddled forward,
came into the kitchen. Landsmann stopped
short at a respectful distance from Erna, eyed her
furiously and shouted imprecations. She paid no
attention to him, but continued her pleasant task, her
face alight with animal joy and brutality. The rat&rsquo;s
life was soon extinguished, due, perhaps, more to
Erna&rsquo;s fingers than the water. Proudly holding it
out by the tail for display, she dropped the body
into a pail under the sink.
</p>

<p>
The storekeeper approached her, followed by the
customers. The latter profferred congratulations,
<a id="page-67" class="pagenum" title="67"></a>
but not so Herr Landsmann. He grabbed some
table refuse and dumping it into the pail, piled some
old newspapers on top, all the while averting his
face as much as possible. He then turned upon
Erna, but she stood her ground, defying him, and the
storekeeper was forced to resort to still stronger imprecation.
Erna grew impudent in the knowledge of
her righteousness, and Landsmann had to retreat
once more, but this time with threatening gestures
and for an even angrier consultation with his wife.
The other waitresses refused to return to the kitchen,
but went over to assist Landsmann.
</p>

<p>
The customers, who had been joined by others
from the rear dining room, refused to leave the
kitchen, each one wishing to pay Erna homage by
compliment or by taking her arm. Jimmy Allen
was forgotten. At first, the girl, conscious of the
sensation she had created so accidentally,&mdash;killing
rats was not entirely new to her&mdash;faced her worshippers
with an exultant smile. Soon, she tired of their
praise, and more so of their physical attentions,
a repetition of their usual conduct toward her. Furthermore,
the storekeeper&rsquo;s attitude rankled deeper
and deeper, until anger controlled her. Therefore,
she pushed her way through the gathering, ordered
all back to their tables, a command they obeyed under
<a id="page-68" class="pagenum" title="68"></a>
protest, and returned to her duties with a decidedly
willful air. If only Jimmy were here!
</p>

<p>
Within the next hour or so, Herr Landsmann,
backed by his wife&rsquo;s moral support, came into the
kitchen four times to reprimand Erna. He had even
hunted for other pretexts to scold her. By nine
o&rsquo;clock, when Erna was almost alone in her small
empire, her resentment had reached a state of revolt.
Why didn&rsquo;t he bounce her at once? It would be
better. In fact, she would leave of her own free
will. That would be better still. She would be
free. She had a right to be happy. She had always
been happy. So she would be free, Landsmann,
his wife and the rest of the world notwithstanding.
How she hated and despised them! Let
any one else try to tie her hands!
</p>

<p>
Another half hour passed, and Erna&rsquo;s determination
grew. Her whole fighting instinct had been set
astir. As a result, she had treated the few remaining
customers with contemptuous neglect. They were
all of one breed. And they left, one by one, passing
remarks, laughing or trying to banter her. Soon
she was left to herself and surly reflection, as Landsmann,
luckily, had discontinued molesting her&mdash;for
the present, at least. However, a newcomer entered
the dining room. But he was the highly welcome
Jimmy Allen.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-69" class="pagenum" title="69"></a>
Erna greeted him with joy. She had forgotten
her yesterday&rsquo;s resentment, in his sudden rise to honor
and in her present need. And Jimmy greeted her
with joy. No other word passed between them.
Instead, Jimmy embraced her with all of his brute
strength. He then tried kissing her, only to have
Erna slip from his grasp. Jimmy&rsquo;s blood was
aroused. He pursued Erna, cornered her and caught
her with an even stronger embrace than before,
breathing hard with passion. They overturned a
chair, and Jimmy tripped and lost his hold. They
both breathed rapidly, and stood apart, watching
each other. Herr Landsmann looked into the dining
room, scowled and disappeared.
</p>

<p>
Jimmy again came closer, but Erna shook her
head in warning. She had seen the storekeeper.
Presently, she gave her lover a short nervous account
of her morning&rsquo;s trial. Jimmy swore a generous
oath and begged her to drop her work at once.
But Erna hesitated.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, come out o&rsquo; this!&rdquo; he pleaded.
</p>

<p>
Erna would not answer.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come out o&rsquo; this, Erna!&rdquo; he repeated seriously.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sick o&rsquo; this. I&rsquo;m sick o&rsquo; this. Let&rsquo;s go
away. We&rsquo;re fixed now&mdash;or as good as fixed. The
only job&rsquo;s the minister&rsquo;s. Come on, Erna!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Still, the girl refused to answer, but it was evident
<a id="page-70" class="pagenum" title="70"></a>
that she was weakening&mdash;as Jimmy was aware too.
Hurriedly, he recounted his victory of last night,
emphasized the fact that he was stronger than ever,
knew &ldquo;more about the game,&rdquo; and outlined the near
future: that he was soon to meet Young Walcott,
whom he would dispose of, and some unknown from
Chicago. He would have quite a little money shortly,
and he could support her &ldquo;as a decent woman
should be supported.&rdquo; She would be happy. They
would both be happy. &ldquo;Come on, Erna!&rdquo; he concluded.
&ldquo;Be a sport!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Erna was in a groggy state. One last stinging
argument would have finished her. She hesitated, as
did Jimmy, who, unfortunately, resorted to stalling.
</p>

<p>
At length, she said: &ldquo;Gimme until to-night!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Now, Jimmy missed entirely: &ldquo;But I say, Erna.
I got an important date then.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Her resentment returned at once. She recalled
his neglect of yesterday. &ldquo;What?&rdquo; she demanded
jealously.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I got to see Nolan an&rsquo; Walcott an&rsquo; his manager
to-night. We got to talk over an&rsquo; arrange things.
Besides, Nolan&rsquo;s givin&rsquo; a little spread in my honor
among the boys. Can&rsquo;t you tell me now? Tell me
now!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I said <em>to-night</em>, didn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; she retorted in dangerous
tones.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-71" class="pagenum" title="71"></a>
&ldquo;I know, Erna, but I can&rsquo;t see you to-night.
Make it to-morrow night, an&rsquo; we&rsquo;ll talk it over, long&rsquo;s
you won&rsquo;t say now. Make it to-morrow night! An&rsquo;
I&rsquo;ll spend the whole evenin&rsquo; with you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Erna had turned her back on him. Jimmy came
closer, but she walked away, while he followed her,
foolishly continuing to apologize and to cajole her.
Unhappily, Jimmy&rsquo;s suit was interrupted. Another
man came into the dining room: Eric Nielsen.
</p>

<p>
Glances passed between them. Nielsen went over
to the farthermost corner, took off his hat and coat
and sat down. Jimmy looked at Erna on the sly,
but she paid no attention to him. The young fighter
did not stay for breakfast. He left the room without
another word. And Erna smiled secretly.
</p>

<p>
Nielsen, always a lover of other&rsquo;s secrets, had
digested most of the scene. But he was still a diplomat.
Consequently, he said nothing and permitted
Erna to come over for his order. She looked nervous
and uncertain.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s new?&rdquo; he asked pleasantly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nothin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Still ham and eggs and the old program?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She smiled slightly. &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He ordered some eggs, toast and a cup of black
coffee and explained: &ldquo;I need some energy for work
this morning. I feel dopy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-72" class="pagenum" title="72"></a>
Erna smiled again and went away. She was feeling
a little better. There was always something
soothing in Nielsen and his banter. And she did
not wait in the kitchen for his order, but came back
to his table. Erna rarely acted parts in Nielsen&rsquo;s
company.
</p>

<p>
He looked up sympathetically. He wanted to
ask her what was wrong, but knowing her antipathy
for expressed sympathy or soft advances, remained
silent. Herr Landsmann looked in upon them. Erna
flushed with her old resentment, and the storekeeper
frowned and disappeared. Nielsen remarked the exchange.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, is it?&rdquo; he observed gently.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The boss?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She was thoughtful and then admitted: &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the Dutchman done?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Slowly, and not without reluctance in the beginning,
she told him the details, he interrupting her
once or twice with encouragement. &ldquo;Shades of
Norway!&rdquo; he exclaimed in admiration. &ldquo;You could
easily play the Rat-wife in &lsquo;Little Eyolf&rsquo;.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She looked at him in a puzzled way, but he
laughed and advised her: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mind me; I&rsquo;m
cracked. Go on!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Erna related the rest of the incident. He was
quietly attentive to every detail, and at the conclusion
<a id="page-73" class="pagenum" title="73"></a>
of her recital, broke out cheerfully: &ldquo;The
trouble with the German is that he&rsquo;s too slow to catch
even a cockroach. Therefore, he resents speed. So
Landsmann calls you down. And the girls&mdash;well,
they&rsquo;re children, like most females. You&rsquo;re entirely
too dramatic for their comfort.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Erna never quite understood Nielsen, but she mellowed
down to some of her old good nature. Nielsen
continued his reassuring nonsense, and gradually,
the rest of her good nature was restored. The young
writer was not slow to notice the change, and he
was glad to have been of service to her. He had
no desire to make any personal use of Erna&rsquo;s present
mental condition, but nevertheless, he proceeded:
&ldquo;Erna, you must be tired.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Certainly. You need a little rest&mdash;a little diversion.
Let me help you out; there&rsquo;s a sensible girl.
Will you come over and spend part of the evening
with me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
His request had not been a bold one; he had
made it seriously, and with no thought of himself.
But Erna gave him a sharp look. He met her glance
with an honest one and pursued: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you
to pose for the story, as I asked you yesterday&mdash;honestly,
I don&rsquo;t. I just want to amuse you a little,
<a id="page-74" class="pagenum" title="74"></a>
if I can. You need a bit of a change, even by having
me supply it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
This was approaching dangerously close to a soft
advance, but Erna did not heed it. She was still
busy trying to read Nielsen, but reading Nielsen was
not so easy as appearances would have led one to
believe. However, she was able to read humanity
behind his lurking smile, and likewise his seriousness
of purpose. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she said in doubt.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not afraid?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she admitted.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come ahead then. We&rsquo;ll have a quiet little
evening together, or you can tell me some more about
your enemies, German and others. As for posing,
I&rsquo;ll do the posing, such as standing on my head, for
example.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Erna had always felt that Nielsen was human. It
now come as a realization. She gave him a final
penetrating glance. He smiled frankly, and she had
to smile as well. &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; she resigned.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a good sport, Erna,&rdquo; he complimented
her. &ldquo;But you&rsquo;re too trusting, I&rsquo;m afraid.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Think so?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She looked somewhat doubtful, and then her face
cleared. Nielsen understood.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-75" class="pagenum" title="75"></a>
&ldquo;Your order&rsquo;s ready, Erna,&rdquo; came Landsmann&rsquo;s
voice.
</p>

<p>
And the girl hurried out.
</p>

</h2>

</div>

<p class="first">
Erna was in a splendid mood when she called on
Nielsen that evening. In the first place, the young
Norwegian-American had earned her gratitude.
Secondly, and what is perhaps more important,
Jimmy Allen had come into Landsmann&rsquo;s both for the
noon and the evening meal and had paid her humble
devotion. She had agreed to spend to-morrow evening
with him, but principally that she might add
coal to the fire of his impatience by putting off her
answer, which she had not formed as yet but in the
existence of which she had succeeded in leading him
to believe. Thirdly, she had had two more tilts with
Landsmann and was victorious in both. Consequently,
Erna was in high spirit. In addition, her
greedy nature was looking forward to the new sensation
that life might be on the point of offering her in
Nielsen.
</p>

<p>
It was evident at once that he was likewise in the
best of humor. His greeting of Erna was of the
heartiest cordiality and cheer. And he required only
a minute or two to settle her comfortably on the
couch and to make her feel otherwise at home. She
was not surprised. On the contrary, she entered immediately
<a id="page-77" class="pagenum" title="77"></a>
into the mood of the young writer&rsquo;s hospitality.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, Rat-wife, how&rsquo;ve you been?&rdquo; he commenced.
&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen you since this morning.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why do you call me Rat-wife?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Because you&rsquo;re a professional rat catcher.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve caught rats before,&rdquo; she confessed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Have you? Great! I always thought you must
have had another vocation in life.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But I hate caterpillars, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she declared
naïvely.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;By all means,&rdquo; he agreed. &ldquo;They give one the
fuzzy-wuzzies, don&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They both laughed. He drew his chair closer to
the couch and watched her frankly. She watched
him with equal candor. There was honest admiration
in his next remark: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re strong, aren&rsquo;t
you, Erna?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How&rsquo;d you get that way?&rdquo; he pursued.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I must &rsquo;a&rsquo; been born that way. I guess my father
an&rsquo; mother were strong an&rsquo; healthy. Any way, I
exercise a great deal&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;In the store, you mean?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, at night, by the open window, in&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not in the nude?&rdquo; he ventured.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-78" class="pagenum" title="78"></a>
&ldquo;Not quite, but almost!&rdquo; she admitted, and they
laughed again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But Erna, what made you say you <em>guess</em> your
father and mother were strong? Don&rsquo;t you know
whether they were? Aren&rsquo;t they alive?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She looked at him suddenly, but his straightforward
glance reassured her. She announced quietly:
&ldquo;I never saw my parents.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What?&rdquo; he broke out. &ldquo;Then how&mdash;but I beg
your pardon, child. I didn&rsquo;t mean to be inquisitive.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not inquisitive,&rdquo; she returned with unaccustomed
seriousness. &ldquo;Only&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; he interrupted. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak of
it! It&rsquo;s too painful. Besides, we mustn&rsquo;t be growing
gloomy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Erna was meditative. She had never confided
that part of her life to any one. It might be nice to
unburden some of it. And Mr. Nielsen&mdash;he was so&mdash;She
glanced at him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; he requested. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d much rather
you wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She smiled and said: &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t so sad; it&rsquo;s just
kind o&rsquo; funny.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, if it&rsquo;s funny, out with it, but if it isn&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s kind o&rsquo; funny that I should be tellin&rsquo; at all.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;To me, you mean?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-79" class="pagenum" title="79"></a>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s easy. You trust me; that&rsquo;s the reason,&rdquo;
he explained jocularly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do I? How do you know?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m a wise old know-it-all. Which is certainly
a nice bunch of conceit, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she denied good-humoredly.
</p>

<p>
Without pretense of any sort, and completely at
her ease sitting there on the couch only a yard or two
from him, she gave Nielsen a few points in her
knowledge of past years. Briefly, she laid claim to
having lived nearly all her life with adopted parents,
from whom, thanks to their continued selfishness and
maltreatment, she had run away about a year ago.
These people had once informed her that her father
had married some woman of position in Bohemia,
where Erna was born, and that, having squandered
her money, he had disappeared for good. Her
mother had died in giving birth to her, and her
adopted parents, related to him as cousins, had received
her indirectly through some friends of her
father&rsquo;s, as well as money, through various mysterious
channels, up to her sixth year. The remittances
stopped suddenly, and she was left a beggar on their
hands, a fact of which they were often careful to remind
her. At the age of twelve or thirteen, Erna
had hunted for and found a situation, and later
others, and had been able to pay some sort of board
<a id="page-80" class="pagenum" title="80"></a>
through the intervening years. But her &ldquo;parents,&rdquo;
who had five children of their own, despised her and
maltreated her accordingly, as did the children,
guided by the elders&rsquo; precepts. Only her strength
of body and endowed pugnaciousness had saved her
from greater maltreatment.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And this you call a funny story?&rdquo; demanded
Nielsen, stopping her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing so very sad in it,&rdquo; she declared
stubbornly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
His admiration for her developed. Erna certainly
possessed sterling qualities.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But I haven&rsquo;t finished,&rdquo; she interposed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Never mind, Erna. I&rsquo;ve heard enough.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t heard why I quit my &lsquo;parents&rsquo;.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have to,&rdquo; he tried to stop her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s only a little to it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They tried to sell me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Just what I said.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They tried to sell me to an old admirer o&rsquo; mine
in Paterson.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You must be crazy, child.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-81" class="pagenum" title="81"></a>
&ldquo;No more&rsquo;n you,&rdquo; she insisted. &ldquo;The man was
all ready with his money an&rsquo;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But this is impossible,&rdquo; he interrupted.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, it isn&rsquo;t. I ought to know. It made me
jump the track.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s how you ran away?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A year ago?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes. It was the last straw. They&rsquo;d tried the
same game twice before. I was through.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Nielsen eyed her in sympathy. He had not credited
the whole of her story, incoherent and almost
imaginary as some of its details sounded, but the
climax had moved him deeply. He was not as
superficial as his outward demeanor might indicate.
But he was still a diplomat, and knowing Erna&rsquo;s
nature better than ever now, did not offer her open
sympathy. Instead, he questioned: &ldquo;So you wandered
around New York looking for jobs?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Till you landed at Landsmann&rsquo;s?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh no, I had two other jobs before that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;At other bakeries, but I was fired.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;For&mdash;for sassing back?&rdquo; he asked, smiling.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, just as I sass old Landsmann.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-82" class="pagenum" title="82"></a>
He grew serious. &ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t you better be careful?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;About angering Landsmann?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it. I hate him. I hate Germans.
My &lsquo;parents&rsquo; were German an&rsquo;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He may fire you too.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t want to be forced to run about
New York again, do you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Erna was about to break out, thinking of Jimmy,
&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t have to,&rdquo; but substituted staring at Nielsen.
He was so fine, so human, so&mdash;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Never mind, Erna! Let&rsquo;s talk of something
more cheerful.&rdquo; Suddenly, it was his turn to look
thoughtful. Before he was aware of himself, he
commenced: &ldquo;Erna!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If you ever need anybody&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I mean in case you should ever lose your job&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t hesitate to come to me for help.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He had spoken in a more earnest tone than was
his custom. Erna looked quantities of gratitude.
&ldquo;Do you mean&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he forestalled her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a man, Erna, or
<a id="page-83" class="pagenum" title="83"></a>
a part o&rsquo; one. I know you&rsquo;re a good sport, I&rsquo;ve seen
so much evidence of it. In fact, you&rsquo;re as good and
probably a better sport than I am&rdquo;&mdash;all this with a
return to banter&mdash;&ldquo;so it&rsquo;s up to me, if you ever need
assistance.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Erna was unable to reply.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Will you?&rdquo; he requested more quietly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she agreed, and was silent.
</p>

<p>
Presently, he came back to the whimsical. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
a funeral party, aren&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, we can start a partnership as funeral directors
to bury the past, can&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Nielsen laughed, and she followed his example.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Erna, I envy you,&rdquo; he started again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nothing downs you long. You&rsquo;re such a happy
Indian that you&rsquo;re able to run your world.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Am I?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes. It takes happy people to run the world,
you know.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Does it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Certainly. That&rsquo;s my humble belief anyhow.
Dost believe in philosophy?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No time for it!&rdquo; she returned.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; he applauded. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a
<a id="page-84" class="pagenum" title="84"></a>
pastime for lemon natures. Stick to your joy,
Erna!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Erna was indulging in more abstract matters than
she had ever attempted, for she said: &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help
it, I suppose. I love joy and happy people. An&rsquo;
fresh air, strength, freedom.&rdquo; But it was Nielsen&rsquo;s
fault, he used such a subtle method of probing her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll do, Erna,&rdquo; he interrupted. &ldquo;You have
spoken. There is nothing to be added to fresh air,
the breeder of strength, the breeder of freedom.
This ought to be enough philosophy for one day, eh?
We&rsquo;ll have headaches soon, won&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not me!&rdquo; she denied, and he laughed and
added: &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll close the sermon with a little
text, if I may.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Go ahead.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Whatever happens,&rdquo; he bantered her; &ldquo;stick to
your freedom with your last dying breath!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thanks!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The evening developed even further intimacy.
And Erna soon came to realize that she had discovered
her new sensation. As for Nielsen, he was
spending an unusual evening too. Several times, he
thought of Jimmy Allen and his connection with
Erna. He was a splendid joyous animal like her.
It did not surprise him that he had been restored to
her favor, they were so well mated. And he recalled
<a id="page-85" class="pagenum" title="85"></a>
the short but significant scene he had spoiled
that morning.
</p>

<p>
Erna, surely, was a rare nature,&mdash;hard, perhaps,
selfish and cruel in many ways too, quite a little more
so than others, but her strength of will, self reliance
and her stubborn pursuit of pleasure and excitement&mdash;her
life of joy&mdash;were irresistible. And she was
only a waitress. But she was far more than that,
an individual, as Carstairs had vaunted that time;
she had lived a life harder to endure than that loaded
upon his educated acquaintances, for example, and
yet, she, lacking their knowledge and so called experience
and wisdom, controlled life; life did not
control her. And Nielsen, who seldom overlooked
dissecting himself along with others, admitted readily
that Erna attracted him powerfully, and not in the
name of the story, which he had forgotten&mdash;for the
present, anyhow.
</p>

<p>
Erna&rsquo;s mind was making more rapid calculations
than ever before. &ldquo;Stick to your freedom!&rdquo; he had
advised her. It was true. She must go on fighting
for that. But what of Jimmy&mdash;and marriage?
Marriage, that word with a bad taste, marriage even
with Jimmy would steal a good portion of her freedom.
She must be careful. Besides, her power
over Jimmy was so easy just the same. And Nielsen,
that puzzling human man, disconcerted her. He
<a id="page-86" class="pagenum" title="86"></a>
was different from Jimmy. He was strong physically
too, if not quite as handsome, and he possessed
a strong heart and mind, which Jimmy did not. But
his constant joking&mdash;was he really serious? She
never knew just where to find him, he eluded her so.
If she were to marry, she would never see him again,
a prospect her greediness did not like to consider, as
she sat there slyly watching him, clothed in that easy,
cheerful, even-tempered strength of his.
</p>

<p>
Erna and Nielsen did not leave the latter&rsquo;s workshop
until close upon midnight. The rest of the time
had passed swiftly and pleasantly. Their parting
was warm to a decided degree. And they made an
appointment for the following Friday evening.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be a night owl soon,&rdquo; she complained.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh no&mdash;you&rsquo;ll always be a Rat-wife,&rdquo; he corrected.
</p>

<p>
She pressed the book under her arm&mdash;Ibsen&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Little Eyolf,&rdquo; which he had lent her&mdash;and
laughed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now, don&rsquo;t forget my text,&rdquo; he warned her
gently, as they stood on the dark street corner near
Landsmann&rsquo;s, their hands clasped in friendly embrace.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And if there&rsquo;s any real trouble with Landsmann?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-87" class="pagenum" title="87"></a>
&ldquo;Yes, I will,&rdquo; she agreed.
</p>

<p>
He pressed her hand.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good-night,&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good-night,&rdquo; he returned.
</p>

<p>
And they separated. But they both looked back
twice and waved their hands&mdash;in the old fashioned
way.

</h2>

</div>

<p class="first">
&ldquo;An order of mocha tart, Erna!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was Bainbridge Breen who had spoken. The
girl left the dining room with a cheery: &ldquo;All right!&rdquo;
The young artist turned to his friends, Carstairs and
Nielsen, who were sitting with him at the rear table:
&ldquo;Mocha tart is still the prince of Landsmann pastries.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve made up with Erna, I see,&rdquo; Nielsen
ventured quietly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, of course! I&rsquo;m too busy a man to spend
any time harboring animosity. Besides, I guess I&rsquo;m
sufficiently broad-minded to forgive the girl her indiscretion.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And on her side, she&rsquo;s too light-hearted to hold
animosity,&rdquo; the author supplied.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I expect so,&rdquo; Breen agreed generously, and then
challenged: &ldquo;But how about <em>you</em> and Erna? And
how about your story?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t been able to finish it as yet,&rdquo; Nielsen
returned somewhat evasively.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t had enough opportunity for <em>studying</em>
Erna?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not quite through.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-89" class="pagenum" title="89"></a>
Breen laughed significantly, and Carstairs flushed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then you haven&rsquo;t reached your decision as regards
Erna&rsquo;s morals?&rdquo; the painter continued.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not just yet!&rdquo; was Nielsen&rsquo;s response, keyed in
deeper evasiveness.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll reach my conclusion absolutely,&rdquo; Breen
closed confidently. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a moral little thing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Carstairs interposed indignantly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Whoop-la!&rdquo; cried Breen. &ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve come to
<em>your</em> decision, Brother John? How did it happen,
you sly dog?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t come to any decision,&rdquo; Carstairs denied
wearily. &ldquo;I told you in the beginning what I
thought of Erna.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; Breen gave in with a tone of fatherly
wisdom. &ldquo;But when and where did you find opportunity
to strengthen your belief? You haven&rsquo;t been
coming here very often of late?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my affair,&rdquo; Carstairs retorted.
</p>

<p>
He was in a melancholy mood. Erna had been
neglecting him since their evening together. Moreover,
she had treated him with more or less indifference
as well, as though his visits bored her, and had
allowed him no opening for inviting her again.
</p>

<p>
Nielsen wisely changed the subject: &ldquo;Been doing
much work lately, John?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve been busy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-90" class="pagenum" title="90"></a>
&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been writing a little set of piano songs,&rdquo; he
rejoined.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good for you!&rdquo; Breen applauded. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
nothing like work after all, and we all seem engaged
to that lady at present. She&rsquo;s the best wife in the
world.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Nielsen smiled philosophically, but the tired expression
had revisited Carstairs&rsquo; face. The trio continued
eating their supper, and the conversation
strayed to other and less personal topics.
</p>

<p>
That same evening, Erna was to meet Jimmy
Allen. The hero of Landsmann&rsquo;s was well ahead
of their appointment time, for he was strangely excited.
He had some news to impart to Erna.
</p>

<p>
She was ten minutes late. He did not call her
attention to the fact, but greeted her boisterously
and began: &ldquo;Gee, Erna! I got great news for you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Have you?&rdquo; she replied with well feigned indifference.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What do you think? Nolan&rsquo;s offered to let us
have the rooms free for one month.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Did he?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sure! What do you think o&rsquo; that? Ain&rsquo;t he
the pippin? Ain&rsquo;t he the classy guy?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She did not answer. They were walking slowly.
<a id="page-91" class="pagenum" title="91"></a>
He grabbed her arm. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter now?&rdquo;
he demanded.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nothin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You said you&rsquo;d made up your mind,&rdquo; he maintained
anxiously.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I said: not quite,&rdquo; she corrected him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, but you have, Erna,&rdquo; he pleaded. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
join hands with me? You&rsquo;re sick o&rsquo; Landsmann&rsquo;s.
You&mdash;we&rsquo;re stuck on each other, an&rsquo; the minister&rsquo;s&mdash;Well,
wait&rsquo;ll you see the flat!&rdquo; he broke off.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll settle it. Wait&rsquo;ll you see the <em>flat</em>!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m takin&rsquo; you there,&rdquo; he informed her eagerly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; he cajoled her. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll come,
won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; and he squeezed her arm. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no
harm in it. You don&rsquo;t have to like the place? It
don&rsquo;t hurt to see it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll go.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Erna was busy eyeing a millinery show window.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How about it?&rdquo; he questioned.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All right.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He sighed with relief and satisfaction.
</p>

<p class="tb">
&nbsp;
</p>

<p class="noindent">
There were two rooms and a bath. The furnishings
were fairly attractive&mdash;garish in some respects,
<a id="page-92" class="pagenum" title="92"></a>
but on the whole, adequate. Erna admitted to herself
that they surpassed her expectation, the garish
qualities, no doubt, appealing to her love of life and
violent color. But she made no such admission to
Jimmy.
</p>

<p>
He was watching her with wide open eyes. Gradually,
his anxiety forsook him and his natural cheerfulness
appeared. &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he asked quietly.
</p>

<p>
Erna continued reticent. Neither of the rooms
compared with Mr. Nielsen&rsquo;s, which was so wonderfully
cosy, but she could easily improve them.
Her woman&rsquo;s housekeeper instinct declared itself;
it would be nice to occupy herself making changes
here and there. And it would be a nice place to
spend a few lazy hours every day, it was such a fine
little apartment. Best of all, it would be her first
home.... Erna studied the large couch for the
first time and hesitated. &ldquo;Stick to your freedom!&rdquo;
he had advised her. Marriage? No, marriage
would not be so nice. Still, strong, broad shouldered,
handsome, happy Jimmy was standing right
near her. She glanced his way.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he repeated.
</p>

<p>
Erna looked away.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; he asked, and approached
a little.
</p>

<p>
She did not answer.... That other time matters
<a id="page-93" class="pagenum" title="93"></a>
were different. She had not felt as drawn to him
then as she had since his return. His offer of money
that day&mdash;well, it had been an honest one: he
had cared for her, and he had been her best friend
in those days. She must do him that much justice.
And he was offering her much more now. She hated
Landsmann&rsquo;s more and more. She could not endure
the place many days longer. And this would be her
first home. But suppose she should want to change&mdash;as
she had done so often before, due to her hatred
of any steady existence? Her hands would be tied.
Marriage meant loss of freedom. She cared for
Jimmy, yes, but not quite enough. If she were only
given more time for a decision! Perhaps, Mr. Nielsen
would help her to decide. But she would not
ask <em>him</em>.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; Jimmy demanded once
more and with returning anxiety. He came closer.
</p>

<p>
Erna turned toward him. She cast aside the part
she usually played with him, and gave him the first
honest glance he had received from her in several
days. He quickly put his arm about her shoulders.
</p>

<p>
Erna turned her head away and tried to pull back,
but his other arm found its way about her. &ldquo;Erna!&rdquo;
he begged for the last time.
</p>

<p>
She commenced to struggle. His instincts of battle
were aroused; and his exasperation of nearly two
<a id="page-94" class="pagenum" title="94"></a>
years&rsquo; standing seized this opportunity. Heedless
of her cries, he tightened his grip and pressed her
breast against his with brutal strength. There was a
moment of tugging and swaying. Suddenly, Erna
raised her face, and he kissed her mouth with the
same undeniable brutality. The girl no longer struggled.
But he would not let her go.
</p>

<p>
At length, she tried to break away, but his strength
was much greater than hers. He continued to
weaken her, strong and stubborn though she was, by
more unmerciful kisses and embraces. Erna attempted
to beat his breast with what freedom her
hands were permitted and not succeeding, kicked his
shins. But Jimmy, laughing with joy and suffering
with passion, hugged her with such finality that she
was left powerless.
</p>

<p>
As usual, that old but simple law of physics, concerning
the continued contact of bodies, was vindicated.
Soon after, it was satisfied. Erna and
Jimmy did not rise from the couch for nearly three
hours.
</p>

<p>
Erna was tired, but happy. She looked at Jimmy.
He laughed. She laughed too. And then they
laughed together. Suddenly, she became serious.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the trouble?&rdquo; he questioned.
</p>

<p>
Erna looked at him differently now, but her
seriousness soon fled. After all, just as posing for
<a id="page-95" class="pagenum" title="95"></a>
Breen had not been quite new to her, so her present
experience was not quite new. Furthermore, Erna
possessed unlimited gameness. Life had never been
able to throw her for a long fall. Therefore, her
boldness returned. Jimmy laughed as before, and
she joined him once more.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All right?&rdquo; he requested.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He got up. She watched him dress. He was
slow and careless in the performance. But her attention
was absorbed by the muscular play of his
splendid body.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he asked smiling.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well what?&rdquo; she challenged.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What makes you stare?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nothin&rsquo;!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Am I nothin&rsquo;?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He laughed with his usual readiness, and content,
turned his back on her with lazy ease and walked
over to the mirror. Erna frowned slightly. Somehow,
his &ldquo;I&rdquo; had put her on her old guard. It
seemed to spell property, as did his care-free satisfaction
with himself. Erna watched him with
glances sharpened by caution.
</p>

<p>
But it was necessary to dress. She was beginning
<a id="page-96" class="pagenum" title="96"></a>
to feel chilly. Without getting up, she slipped on
her waist, that had been lying nearby on the floor.
</p>

<p>
Jimmy Allen&rsquo;s mood had reached a state of hopeless
disregard. He committed a decided blunder.
With cheerful candor, he asked, without troubling
himself to turn around: &ldquo;Erna! When do we move
in?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She gave his back an indignant glance. &ldquo;What
did you say?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I said: when do we move in?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Her instinct was up in arms. Throwing coolness
into her reply, she returned deliberately: &ldquo;Not
until doomsday.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He stopped fixing his tie. But he continued:
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re gettin&rsquo; crazy again.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not,&rdquo; she replied without changing her tone.
&ldquo;I said: not until doomsday.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He turned toward her, smiling. But the smile left
his face. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter now?&rdquo; he asked, coming
forward.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Go on dressin&rsquo;!&rdquo; she commanded, his smile having
started her petulance.
</p>

<p>
He, however, had come over to the couch and now
stood over her, staring at her stupidly. She looked
up at him, animosity in her glance. His vapid expression
deepened.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; she challenged.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-97" class="pagenum" title="97"></a>
&ldquo;Sore?&rdquo; he asked humbly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He tried to study her. Gradually, light penetrated
his cloudy understanding: Erna was just like other
women. Luckily, some stroke of intuition prompted
him not to turn away this time. Instead, he put his
hands on her shoulders and said with unaccustomed
seriousness: &ldquo;Erna! Don&rsquo;t be sore.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sore,&rdquo; she resented.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I know&mdash;but&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to explain,&rdquo; she cried melodramatically.
Strange to say, Erna seemed ready
to cry.
</p>

<p>
At a loss, Jimmy tried philosophy: &ldquo;&rsquo;Cause life
is Hell to some folks, Erna, we don&rsquo;t have to imitate
&rsquo;em, do we?&rdquo; He could not tell whether she was
listening. &ldquo;Gimme a chance!&rdquo; he added more cheerfully.
&ldquo;Quit the beanery an&rsquo; gimme a chance! I
don&rsquo;t want life to be Hell for you. Gimme the
chance, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; He waited, but she did not
look up. &ldquo;You listenin&rsquo;?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then quit the beanery, Erna! We can live nice
an&rsquo; cosy an&rsquo; happy here, can&rsquo;t we? You like it
here?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she admitted.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-98" class="pagenum" title="98"></a>
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get the minister then!&rdquo; he concluded quietly.
</p>

<p>
She removed his hands from her shoulders.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Erna!&rdquo; he repeated.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Wait a moment,&rdquo; she cut him short, although
in a milder tone.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Stick to your freedom!&rdquo; he had advised her. He
was so human that he understood everything. And
yet, Jimmy&mdash;if she were not forced to decide so
soon!
</p>

<p>
Her strength came back under the influence of this
tonic. A little of her innate cheerfulness revived
as well. She looked up at Jimmy. His puzzled expression
disappeared, and he smiled in encouragement.
She smiled too.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Got somethin&rsquo; to say,&rdquo; he read. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Marriage&rsquo;d be Hell, Jimmy,&rdquo; she announced
without emotion.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; he demanded abruptly, but recollecting
himself, stopped. Dimly, he once more realized that
Erna was a woman. And the man&rsquo;s psychology
assisted him: Nature and his long enduring exasperation
had been satisfied. Why worry his head trying
to understand Erna? Let her take care of herself.
She would outgrow her present mood. He grew
blasé, and repeated quietly: &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-99" class="pagenum" title="99"></a>
&ldquo;I dunno,&rdquo; she explained doubtfully. &ldquo;Just because,
I suppose.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He sat down beside her, not so much to help her
wrestle with the problem as to encourage her to
speak. She was thoughtful. &ldquo;I guess I don&rsquo;t want
to,&rdquo; she continued, but with increasing doubt.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want to marry? Why?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t be free,&rdquo; she declared in an uncertain
way.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d be free?
You could do what you want. I wouldn&rsquo;t stop
you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She shook her head.
</p>

<p>
An idea came to him. &ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;d rather&mdash;&rdquo;
but he stopped, remembering a former experience.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Go ahead,&rdquo; she advised him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get sore again,&rdquo; he protested.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she disagreed, but anticipated him
with: &ldquo;I know what you were goin&rsquo; to say.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You do? Well?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Erna averted her glance. The old thoughts
passed in quick review: Landsmann&rsquo;s&mdash;Mr. Nielsen&rsquo;s
advice&mdash;scraps of the past&mdash;home. She could
live with him a little while and then marry him if all
went well. That seemed best for her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Wait&rsquo;ll to-morrow!&rdquo; he interrupted her.
<a id="page-100" class="pagenum" title="100"></a>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re kind o&rsquo; up in the air now. You&rsquo;ll be surer
to-morrow.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She nodded absent-mindedly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll let me know to-morrow?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sure?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All right! Forget it! We&rsquo;ll get it all settled
to-morrow. An&rsquo; if you&rsquo;d still want to have the minister&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She shook her head negatively. Jimmy appeared
just as well satisfied. He did not understand, but
what was the difference, and what the use of worrying?
&ldquo;You love me, don&rsquo;tcher?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Again, she nodded absent-mindedly. He pushed
her with rough good nature. Presently, he got up,
returned to the mirror and again busied himself
with his tie. Erna likewise continued dressing. She
had reached a decision. And she was cheerful once
more. But she would wait until to-morrow. It
might be better.

</h2>

</div>

<p class="first">
Mollie and Gretchen, the Landsmann waitresses,
were gossipping. It was about eight o&rsquo;clock, the next
morning. Above the rattle of dishes in the kitchen,
this is what one might have overheard:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I saw her with him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So did I a few nights ago.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They must go out every night.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course! She&rsquo;s out every night since he&rsquo;s
back. Who else would she go with?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just like her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes! I always said she&rsquo;d go back to &rsquo;im.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It was <em>me</em> said that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Maybe you did, but I said it first. She&rsquo;s a fine
girl to be workin&rsquo; in an honest place like this to be
goin&rsquo; out with a common prize-fighter.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not to have any more self-respect!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes! I always said she&rsquo;d come to a bad end.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Looks that way!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Their gossipping might have continued indefinitely
had not part of it been heard by an eavesdropper.
She came stealthily into the kitchen and of a sudden,
the waitresses received some resounding slaps. The
pair screamed.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-102" class="pagenum" title="102"></a>
Erna called them one or two unquotable names
and tried to continue her attack. But she saw
Landsmann coming into the kitchen and beat a retreat
into the dining room, although not without this
parting shot: &ldquo;So you&rsquo;re the kind I&rsquo;ve been givin&rsquo;
dresses to!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Herr Landsmann was a busy man. Both waitresses
were trying to explain at the same time. And
Mollie was weeping violently. At length, he succeeded
in holding an excited consultation with the
girls, and with him at their head, they marched out
into the store in ragged single file. The trio hurriedly
argued the case before Mrs. Landsmann, who
was standing behind the counter, guarding the cash
register. Pretty soon, Mollie cried: &ldquo;Here he
comes now!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Jimmy Allen entered. He greeted the Landsmanns
and the waitresses and then some of his
friends, as he passed the store tables. &ldquo;How about
Young Walcott?&rdquo; called one. &ldquo;Next Wednesday,&rdquo;
Jimmy returned. &ldquo;Trainin&rsquo; again?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes,
I start to-day.&rdquo; And the young hero penetrated the
kitchen and stepped down into the dining room.
</p>

<p>
Erna was in a disordered state. Some of the customers
were endeavoring to pacify her, but she refused
their offers. She spied Jimmy and throwing
<a id="page-103" class="pagenum" title="103"></a>
down all caution, hurried over to him. He soon
heard enough details.
</p>

<p>
The young man struck a melodramatic pose.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll clear out o&rsquo; this hole,&rdquo; he exclaimed. She
put her hand on his arm, but he shook it off. &ldquo;Go
up-stairs an&rsquo; pack your things!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But Jimmy&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Never mind!&rdquo; he interrupted. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have
to stay here. If you did, it&rsquo;d be different. Go up-stairs
an&rsquo; pack up!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She looked at him with momentary dread, but
Jimmy waved his hand toward the doorway. Two
of the customers got up to interfere, but he gave
them threatening glances. Erna moved away and
then stopped in uncertainty. &ldquo;Go ahead!&rdquo; he
ordered her. She tried to go, but Landsmann stood
in the doorway. His face was struggling between
anger and dignity.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Erna!&rdquo; he commanded.
</p>

<p>
She stared at him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Go right up-stairs and&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The storekeeper noticed Jimmy&rsquo;s threatening attitude
and hesitated. &ldquo;Go on!&rdquo; that individual encouraged
him. &ldquo;Got any more to say?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Evidently, the German had not.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then get &rsquo;er money ready an&rsquo; see there ain&rsquo;t a
cent short, you lousy Dutchman! I&rsquo;ll see she gets
<a id="page-104" class="pagenum" title="104"></a>
her <a id="corr-10"></a>deserts. Hurry up, you fat slob, or I&rsquo;ll help
you!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Herr Landsmann disappeared and so did Erna.
Jimmy, master of the moment, gave the dining room
denizens a look of contemptuous pride and likewise
went out.
</p>

<p>
Consternation prevailed. Each patron wanted to
express an opinion, and argument rose high. Only
one of them held his peace: John Carstairs. He sat
aloof, a picture of gloom and stupor.
</p>

<p class="tb">
&nbsp;
</p>

<p class="noindent">
It was an early hour that evening. Carstairs was
seated at the piano in his small cosy room. The gas
was turned fairly low. Except for intermittent
sounds from the instrument, the room was quiet.
</p>

<p>
The young man was composing. Vague measures,
desolate of all cheer, followed one another in
funeral tempo. The monotony, unbroken by even
one note of prophecying gladness, was maddening.
But the young man persisted in his lugubrious incantation.
Presently, he got up, turned the gas a little
higher and sat down again. A sheet of music paper
lay in front of him. Only a few measures and the
title&mdash;Dirge&mdash;had been transcribed. He started
jotting down more notes.
</p>

<p>
There was a knock at the door. He did not hear
<a id="page-105" class="pagenum" title="105"></a>
it. The knock was repeated. Carstairs struck a
petulant dissonance, arose wearily, went over to the
door and opened it part way.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Special delivery!&rdquo; a man announced.
</p>

<p>
Carstairs signed the slip, the postman went away
and the door was closed. The young composer examined
the handwriting and quickly tore open the
envelope. The note was very short.
</p>

<p>
He gave way to eager joy. And he breathed a
name twice over: &ldquo;Elsie!&rdquo; Nervous animation betrayed
him further. He re-read the note five or six
times, looked about in bewilderment and re-read the
note again. Of a sudden, he hurried over to the
bureau and pulled open the bottom drawer. A litter
of odds and ends was laid bare. With anxious
haste, he threw them all about on the floor. At last,
he came to a picture: the photograph of a pretty girl.
His joy deepened; he held the picture at arm&rsquo;s
length and gazed a fill of delight. He then arighted
himself, went over to the piano, moved the photograph
of an older woman to one side and placed this
picture near the centre. He was soon occupied
studying the effect, and ultimate satisfaction was his.
</p>

<p>
He again sat down at the piano, but was unable
to take his glance from the picture. Eventually, he
smiled, gave the picture an <em>au revoir</em> look and again
turned his attention to the keyboard and manuscript.
<a id="page-106" class="pagenum" title="106"></a>
He had decided to finish his composition just the
same. The dirge continued intoning its gloomy
measures, but a note of prophecying gladness appeared.
From time to time, too, the composer stole
shy glances at the photograph.
</p>

<p class="tb">
&nbsp;
</p>

<p class="noindent">
In a cosy room in a building not far away, a
different scene was taking place. Eric Nielsen and
Erna Vitek were sitting close together on a couch,
chatting confidentially and bantering each other.
</p>

<p>
Erna had not broken off her appointment with the
young writer even though a sudden change had
come into her life. Luckily, Jimmy was away all
afternoon, training up in Fordham, and, thanks to
his continued absence, she was able to leave their flat
shortly after six o&rsquo;clock. She would only stay out
an hour or so and, should he return before her,
would tell him that she had to visit Landsmann&rsquo;s for
some small articles she had left behind. On the way
to Nielsen&rsquo;s, she bought two or three trifles. Fortunately,
she had found him at home, although she was
two hours beforehand.
</p>

<p>
He had heard of the morning&rsquo;s event and was
heartily sorry. But Erna quickly reassured him. Of
course, he did not believe the hazy part of her story,&mdash;that
she was &ldquo;stayin&rsquo; with some friends&rdquo;&mdash;but his
<a id="page-107" class="pagenum" title="107"></a>
philosophy was equal to the occasion: what Erna hid
from him was no concern of his. In all, they had
been spending a delightful evening. As a consequence,
Erna was staying much longer than she had
planned.
</p>

<p>
Nielsen enjoyed her company. She was a splendid
stimulant to his stimulant-craving mental system.
After his recent intercourse with the every-day
woman and the every-day man,&mdash;a monotonous gallery
of drab souls&mdash;she was a touch of brilliant color.
Her joy, animal spirit and fighting instinct enthralled
him. She stimulated his imagination particularly
and consequently brought him back to his
old interest in his life and work. So he was trebly indebted
to her.
</p>

<p>
Erna&rsquo;s greed had developed rapidly, and she had
grown reckless in short order. Nielsen inspired her
complete confidence. He did not take her too seriously,
neither did he take her too lightly. This was
just what she had craved so long. As a result, at
the height of her confidence and his bantering comment,
she allowed him to sit next to her, and they
developed their further intimacy. For the present,
she had forgotten Jimmy. He was physical and did
not inspire her as Nielsen&rsquo;s human temperament did
so easily and so quietly. Moreover, her Vitek blood
had been excited.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-108" class="pagenum" title="108"></a>
Therefore, it was inside a natural sequence of happenings
that Nielsen&rsquo;s arm stole about Erna&rsquo;s waist
and that she submitted to the liberty. To tell the
truth, Nielsen was decidedly under the influence of
the wine in her nature and she under that in his.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this wicked?&rdquo; he questioned pleasantly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she denied.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s growing darker,&rdquo; he protested.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So much the better!&rdquo; she retorted.
</p>

<p>
And they both laughed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This is rat time,&rdquo; he warned her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; she vaunted.
</p>

<p>
And they laughed again.
</p>

<p>
Erna did not leave the Nielsen workshop until
well after nine o&rsquo;clock.
</p>

XI
</h2>

</div>

<p class="first">
It was the following Monday noon. Breen and
Nielsen were seated at the last table in Landsmann&rsquo;s
rear dining room, eating and gossipping.
&ldquo;Gretchen!&rdquo; called the former.
</p>

<p>
Erna&rsquo;s successor came forward.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Bring me a mocha tart, please.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, sir&rdquo;&mdash;and the girl walked away.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So you think you&rsquo;ll be able to finish your story?&rdquo;
Breen questioned.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think so,&rdquo; was Nielsen&rsquo;s thoughtful response.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve found the missing link.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But is any story ever finished?&rdquo; Breen protested.
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you always find room for additional
installments?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Not being in an argumentative mood, Nielsen
quietly accepted his friend&rsquo;s criticism. Soon, they
were both meditative. Gretchen brought the mocha
tart and went away. Hers was a peace-loving temperament,
in distinct contrast to Erna&rsquo;s, an opinion
Breen expressed. Nielsen again accepted his
criticism.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;After all,&rdquo; the artist added comfortably:
<a id="page-110" class="pagenum" title="110"></a>
&ldquo;Erna was quite a study. I confess, she fooled
me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How so?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;By running off with that young gladiator.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then you think she&rsquo;s living with him?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course. What other conclusion should I
come to?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Nielsen did not answer. At length he said:
&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;re ready to alter your decision of the
other day?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That she&rsquo;s a moral little thing?&rdquo; Breen replied.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, to some extent,&rdquo; he declared generously.
&ldquo;Her last act does change my first consideration a
bit. But I still refuse to credit her with being <em>un</em>moral.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Which means that you believe her <em>im</em>moral?&rdquo;
Nielsen ventured in a droll tone.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I suppose so.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Explain yourself!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s accepted a life contrary to Society&rsquo;s code
or her own code&mdash;if she was ever unconventional
enough to have one, which I doubt.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Nielsen smiled. &ldquo;If what you say is true, we&rsquo;re
all of us more or less immoral.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why so?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Because every one barters his soul some time during
his existence, and some of us are doing so all the
<a id="page-111" class="pagenum" title="111"></a>
time. At heart, you know, we&rsquo;re most of us, unmoral,
in appearance, moral, but in action, immoral.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Breen laughed in amiable derision. &ldquo;What
scrambled egg philosophy!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Where did
you learn it, noble scholar?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nowhere,&rdquo; Nielsen answered and frowned.
But his ready good nature intervened and he observed
gently: &ldquo;At any rate, Breen, I disagree with
you regarding Erna.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That she&rsquo;s neither moral nor immoral?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She has a little bit of each&mdash;like all of us,&rdquo; the
young author agreed; &ldquo;but fundamentally she&rsquo;s unmoral.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Bravo! So that will be the end of your story?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Nielsen silenced him and smiled
a second time.
</p>

<p>
Breen shook his head with a knowing air. After
an interval, he requested: &ldquo;Will you see her
again?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not certain,&rdquo; Nielsen said without emotion.
&ldquo;I imagine I will some time. But it won&rsquo;t be necessary.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The young men finished their meal.
</p>

<p>
A little later, Nielsen was alone in his studio. He
was sitting at his small writing desk, looking over
some material that lay in front of him. Presently,
he seemed worried, but only for a moment. No, the
<a id="page-112" class="pagenum" title="112"></a>
point was absolutely clear. Erna had settled it for
him the other evening. At heart, she was unmoral.
The young author commenced writing.
</p>

<p>
Through some insidious channel, a thought managed
to come between his mind and the manuscript:
would he see her again? Quickly, he beat it down:
it would be unnecessary to see her again; there was
nothing more for him to learn. Still, he had enjoyed
himself the other evening. The physical, so glorious,
so great, had once more penetrated his life. Would
he drive it away? Nielsen stopped writing.
</p>

<p>
Almost resentfully, he mused: What had he and
the physical to do with each other? The physical
gave him new experience, yes, but it was almost always
experience that he courted and utilized for his
work. He must not expect more; he must continue
to sacrifice everything&mdash;thought, emotion, volition&mdash;to
work. Nothing else existed; in no other way
could he hope to reach the realm of artist. He must
drive Erna and the other evening&rsquo;s sensations from
his memory. She had served as his model, no more;
so he must not permit her personality or his own to
interfere again. Furthermore, he must be cautious
on her behalf as well. She was a joyous, healthy
animal. Jimmy Allen was a joyous, healthy animal.
They were mated, and were living together, undoubtedly.
<a id="page-113" class="pagenum" title="113"></a>
The chapter was closed. He must not
desire more.
</p>

<p>
Nielsen tightened his resolve. In another moment,
he was again busy, writing.
</p>

<p>
There was a knock at the door. He did not
hear it. The knock was repeated more loudly. He
looked around petulantly, got up, went over to the
door and opened it. &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s you,&rdquo; he said, but not
with cordiality.
</p>

<p>
Erna came in.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I was down in the neighborhood,&rdquo; she apologized.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You were right to come up,&rdquo; he reassured her,
sorry to have treated her discourteously. &ldquo;Take off
your things!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re busy,&rdquo; she protested.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not at all. Only a little touch or two I was
working on. They can wait.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Reluctantly, Erna permitted him to help her remove
her coat. She did not take off her hat. &ldquo;Sit
down,&rdquo; he advised her, his regret for his momentary
show of self-interest developing.
</p>

<p>
She sat down on a chair. He seated himself at
his desk, but faced her. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s new?&rdquo; he asked
pleasantly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nothin&rsquo; much,&rdquo; she returned and glanced at
him.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-114" class="pagenum" title="114"></a>
His glance met hers, and he quickly looked elsewhere.
He felt a sharp pain: he had gone too far
the other evening. Erna likewise looked away.
She had seen enough; her instinct knew. There was
an awkward pause.
</p>

<p>
Nielsen gave her a sidelong glance. What could
he do? This was dreadful. He should not have
gone so far. Erna was staring at the floor. He
could see her pugnacious nose and her determined
mouth and chin, and felt somewhat relieved. Her
case might not be as serious as he feared. She had
tenacious strength of character. But the situation
was very uncomfortable notwithstanding. He should
not have gone so far. It was selfish&mdash;whether a
man&rsquo;s selfishness or an artist&rsquo;s. Nielsen turned
away.
</p>

<p>
Again, he glanced in her direction, but she was
still staring at the floor. Luckily, she had Jimmy;
they were living together&mdash;at least, he had taken that
much for granted by putting her story and the bakery
scandal side by side. They were suited to each
other. What could or should she have to do with
such a thing as an artist? Perhaps, the novelty in
their short affair had appealed to her. She was a
greedy nature. She craved everything: sun, moon,
stars and all. He himself had only been one of
<a id="page-115" class="pagenum" title="115"></a>
them. This conjecture satisfied him considerably.
And he breathed with returning freedom.
</p>

<p>
She looked up. He smiled. She smiled too.
And he breathed still more freely.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What have you been doing lately?&rdquo; he questioned
cheerfully.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been busy straightenin&rsquo; out,&rdquo; she replied, and
looked at him.
</p>

<p>
He moved restlessly. There was a second pause,
but only a short one.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been busy too,&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh yes, I&mdash;I&rsquo;ve been working on a story.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What kind of a story?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Merely a foolish little affair about a foolish little
affair,&rdquo; he hastened to condemn.
</p>

<p>
Her glance dropped. His work and her own
lived apart. &ldquo;I brought back &lsquo;Little Eyolf&rsquo;.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So I saw. Did you like it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not very much.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too sad,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;An&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t like
cripples.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; he broke out. &ldquo;I forgot that you
love only joy and happy people.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;An&rsquo; freedom,&rdquo; she concluded unconsciously.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Certainly, and freedom,&rdquo; he agreed.
</p>

<p>
He caught a glimpse of her eyes&mdash;eyes that could
<a id="page-116" class="pagenum" title="116"></a>
love you to-day and hate you to-morrow&mdash;and felt
still more reconciled with circumstances. Erna
craved freedom, and was free. She could take care
of herself. She possessed that rare thing, the life-controlling
temperament. Perhaps, she would not
need even Jimmy Allen. How splendid she was!
Would she hate him to-morrow? It would be a
shame. He had only to raise his hand&mdash;and they
could continue. But he must not, it would be so
much better for her. She would be miserable with
him: an artist and not a physical man. She belonged
to Jimmy&mdash;and still more, to herself. He must not
interfere, but leave her destiny to destiny. Nielsen
felt almost completely relieved.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You <em>love</em> your work, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Erna announced
with unexpected candor.
</p>

<p>
Nielsen looked at her with sharpened eyes. She
was glorious. She had emphasized &ldquo;love&rdquo; and not
&ldquo;work.&rdquo; He could scarcely reply.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she repeated.
</p>

<p>
She was more than glorious. Her own gameness
had fought the problem for her. She required assistance
from no one.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; was all he was able to say, his emotions
crowding him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you write a whole lot?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, lots and lots, but it&rsquo;s all trivial.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-117" class="pagenum" title="117"></a>
&ldquo;Oh no!&rdquo; she contradicted him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh yes!&rdquo; he mimicked her, and laughed, although
he did not know why. &ldquo;My writings are as
much like life&mdash;&rdquo; as you are like art, he would have
finished, but hesitated.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;As what?&rdquo; she assisted him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;As the catching of butterflies is like the catching
of rats,&rdquo; he closed with a return to himself.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, the Rat-wife!&rdquo; she interpreted.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not a rat-wife writer then?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not a butterfly writer either?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;&rsquo;Cause butterflies come from caterpillars, don&rsquo;t
they?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Nielsen admitted and laughed again, although
his emotions were threatening him, as before.
&ldquo;I forgot about the caterpillars.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I hate &rsquo;em,&rdquo; she reminded him. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re
too&mdash;too&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Fuzzy wuzzy!&rdquo; he helped her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she accepted and laughed for the first time,
if not very heartily.
</p>

<p>
Nielsen studied her with frank admiration. Her
nature was that of a lioness. She looked capable of
pushing over or slipping from under any circumstance.
<a id="page-118" class="pagenum" title="118"></a>
She did not even require one&rsquo;s sympathy.
And still?&mdash;But he resisted the temptation. For
her sake, it would be better not to continue.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I must be goin&rsquo;,&rdquo; she said suddenly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh no, not yet!&rdquo; he begged.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I must be goin&rsquo;,&rdquo; she insisted and got up.
&ldquo;I got shoppin&rsquo; to do.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you finished decorating?&rdquo; he inquired,
and got up against his will.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she returned and smiled.
</p>

<p>
Nielsen helped her with her coat. He was tempted
to put his arms about her, but resisted. It would
make her departure more difficult. She turned
around. &ldquo;Is my hat on straight?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; he assured her and added, by way of
controlling himself: &ldquo;<em>Vanitas vanitatum!</em>&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;More triviality!&rdquo; he declared.
</p>

<p>
Erna started toward the door, but he stopped her
with: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want another book to read?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The temptation was a strong one, but she dodged
it: &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ll be too busy now. Maybe, later on,&rdquo;
she concluded with a lingering tone.
</p>

<p>
Nielsen looked away. Erna continued toward the
door, but he hurried after her and opened and held
it open for her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-119" class="pagenum" title="119"></a>
&ldquo;Oh no, not good-bye, but <em>au revoir</em>!&rdquo; he quoted
gently.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a hard word to pronounce.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Try it anyhow,&rdquo; he encouraged her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Orrevore!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Fine!&rdquo; he congratulated her, repeated the
phrase, and added: &ldquo;Come in again soon.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she agreed.
</p>

<p>
But she never did.

XII
</h2>

</div>

<p class="first">
Two months passed.
</p>

<p>
Erna Vitek was still living with Jimmy Allen.
There was, however, less and less likelihood that
they would ever marry. In fact, the most probable
issue to their affair was that they would separate
again, in the near future and this time for good.
</p>

<p>
Erna was tired of Jimmy. For some weeks past,
her restless nature had been craving some one else,
or better still, some other mode of living, her present
one having reached a state of unbearable monotony.
She recovered from her experience with Eric Nielsen
only after several weeks of struggle. Even such a
fine tonic as that supplied her so freely by her resource
of blood found the healing of her wound no
ordinary matter, but she had recovered, except for an
occasional memory. Her battle with her craving for
Nielsen did not assist her attachment for Jimmy; on
the contrary, the latter degenerated by contrast.
And Jimmy, himself, was very much to blame as
well. He had changed toward her.
</p>

<p>
It is no doubt true that possession often breeds
boredom, and boredom, carelessness. Erna, before
possession and after possession, was not the same
<a id="page-121" class="pagenum" title="121"></a>
individual, and Jimmy treated her accordingly. He
was no longer an anxious desire-maddened suitor.
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, he was softening physically. He
continued training for his schedule of fistic contests
and carried out that schedule; he defeated Young
Walcott, the man from Chicago and another, but
lately, had fought two very poor draws, in the latter
of which he, himself, was on the point of being
knocked out. His manager, the astute Jerry Nolan,
was losing patience with him. He bluntly attributed
his protégé&rsquo;s decline to the fact that he was &ldquo;livin&rsquo;
with a woman. A man&rsquo;s got to cut out drink if he
wants to succeed as a athlete, but he&rsquo;s got to be <em>sure</em>
to cut out women. They sucks his blood an&rsquo;
strength.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Jimmy did not agree with this sentiment. He
continued to live with Erna. What is more, he had
threatened to move out of the Nolan apartment and
&ldquo;to throw up the sponge&rdquo;&mdash;quit the prize-ring&mdash;if
his manager persisted in arguing along these lines.
Although Nolan submitted, he found other grounds
upon which to pick quarrels with Jimmy. The truth
is, the young manager was ambitious, and Jimmy&rsquo;s
ability to climb the pugilistic ladder reflected credit
upon him. He had always felt and expressed his
faith in his protégé and prophesied that he would
be &ldquo;mixin&rsquo; it with the top notchers&rdquo; not far hence,
<a id="page-122" class="pagenum" title="122"></a>
a prophecy Jimmy substantiated by defeating &ldquo;the
Kid,&rdquo; Young Walcott and the westerner so decisively.
But he was in danger now, as his recent
battles and his late mutiny testified. Should Jimmy
fall from grace a second time, it would be irrevocably.
Therefore, Nolan was using eloquence, persuasion,
threats, anything, to save him.
</p>

<p>
Many of their quarrels took place in Erna&rsquo;s
presence. After a while, Jimmy, much to her growing
distaste, formed the habit of bringing Nolan and
&ldquo;some o&rsquo; the boys&rdquo; to the flat. Custom gradually
trained them to believe that she was nothing more
than part of the furniture, and they accepted her
attentions, due them as Jimmy&rsquo;s guests, just so.
They stayed well on into the night, amused themselves,
played pranks, broke dishes, quarrelled, made
up&mdash;and came again. And more and more, they
looked upon Erna with contempt. On her side, she
hated and despised them.
</p>

<p>
During the day, Jimmy was usually absent, training
at the Nolan headquarters in Fordham. Erna
saw him for a moment in the morning, when she
prepared his breakfast, and at evening, when she
prepared his supper, not to see him again, as a rule,
until fairly late at night, except when he brought
&ldquo;the boys.&rdquo; To be sure, she slept with him and&mdash;well,
<a id="page-123" class="pagenum" title="123"></a>
she hated that too. It made her feel herself
some dirty, inferior animal.
</p>

<p>
Erna&rsquo;s days were still more monotonous. She
sewed quite a little, attended to details of house
work, which were few, and otherwise, took long
walks or went to an afternoon vaudeville or moving
picture show. As she was accustomed to a day of
constant labor and occupation, she had never known
much idleness; her evenings were spent in resting or
in the search of a little excitement. Moreover,
Erna&rsquo;s was purely an emotional nature; she did not
possess the intellect or imagination so requisite toward
making idleness useful. Unfortunately, she
had no friends to visit.
</p>

<p>
At first, Jimmy gave her money in regular installments.
Their house expenses paid, she would have
a sufficient balance with which to indulge herself&mdash;with
a new hat, a new dress, a few odds and ends,
or her afternoon amusements. The installments,
however, were more and more irregular and smaller
in amount; last week, none had materialized. The
reason was this: Jimmy had returned to drinking.
And the climax was impending. One night, he
came home late, pretty well drunk.
</p>

<p>
Erna opened the door. He swayed and then
staggered into the room, a broad leer on his face.
&ldquo;Howsh&mdash;the&mdash;girl?&rdquo; he demanded stupidly.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-124" class="pagenum" title="124"></a>
He tried to embrace her, but Erna stepped back,
and he nearly fell. With an effort, he straightened
himself and laughed. &ldquo;Wha&mdash;whash&mdash;a&mdash;matter?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Erna&rsquo;s resentment poured over. &ldquo;You beast!&rdquo;
she said in low tones.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&mdash;what?&rdquo; He leaned forward to hear
better.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Beast, I said,&rdquo; and she pelted him with epithets
and reproaches.
</p>

<p>
Jimmy made several ludicrous attempts to apologize,
and protested: &ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m not&mdash;d-drunk; I&mdash;I&rsquo;m
just&mdash;ossified.&rdquo; And he laughed more stupidly
and tried to approach.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Keep away!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Wha&mdash;whash&mdash;a&mdash;matter?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Keep away!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Wheresh&mdash;No&mdash;Nolan?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nolan&rsquo;s in hell, where he belongs,&rdquo; she cried
angrily, and a second tirade followed, directed this
time at the manager and Jimmy&rsquo;s friends.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Be c-c-careful!&rdquo; he interrupted, but she added
further condemnation. &ldquo;Be c-c-careful!&rdquo; he repeated.
&ldquo;No&mdash;Nolan&rsquo;s a frien&rsquo; o&rsquo; mine an&rsquo; so&rsquo;s
P-p-piggy Wallace. Be c-c-careful!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
His defence only succeeded in infuriating her.
She concluded with two or three judgments that included
<a id="page-125" class="pagenum" title="125"></a>
the families of those gentlemen. Jimmy&rsquo;s
good nature stopped. &ldquo;You &mdash;&mdash;!&rdquo; he called her
and stumbled toward her.
</p>

<p>
Erna retreated, her face aflame. Once more, he
called her &mdash;&mdash; and fell toward her. She tried to
ward him off, for he had driven her against the
couch. But Jimmy pushed himself forward and
raising his fist, brought it down clumsily upon her
face. Erna slipped and fell upon the couch, her
mouth bleeding.
</p>

<p>
Furious, she jumped up and attacked Jimmy.
He was in a defenceless condition, and blows rained
upon his shoulders, body and head. He tried to
raise his guard, but it was useless. At length,
swearing incoherently, she struck him full in the
face, and he swayed, mumbled stupidly and toppled
over on the couch, unconscious or asleep&mdash;more
likely the latter. Handsome Jimmy was a disgusting
sight.
</p>

<p>
Erna, still struggling with herself, looked down
at him. He started snoring, a part painful, part
beatific smile wrinkling his face. His legs were
dangling over the side of the couch. She gave them
a kick, lifted them and shoved them onto the couch.
She then turned away and wiped her mouth with her
sleeve. Erna had come to a simple determination.
</p>

<p>
Without hesitation, she went over to a closet and
<a id="page-126" class="pagenum" title="126"></a>
opened the door. She likewise pulled open the
drawer of a commode. And somewhere, she found
an old suit case and dragged that forth. Her packing
did not last more than twenty minutes. She left
a hat, a dress and some odds and ends behind her.
</p>

<p class="tb">
&nbsp;
</p>

<p class="noindent">
One pleasant late afternoon about two weeks
later, Eric Nielsen was occupied in writing at his
desk. He was engaged on an essay he had planned
and started some time ago. His pencil was moving
more rapidly than usual.
</p>

<p>
The door was opened gently and Bainbridge
Breen came in. &ldquo;Busy?&rdquo; he inquired.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come in! I&rsquo;ll be through in a second,&rdquo; Nielsen
returned without looking up.
</p>

<p>
The painter came forward. The author&rsquo;s pencil
scribbled a little faster, a period was jotted down,
and he laid aside the pencil, at the same time eyeing
his work and sighing with satisfaction.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Finished?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh no, not for some time. I&rsquo;ve got several
thousand words more,&rdquo; Nielsen explained.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How&rsquo;s it coming on?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Splendidly!&rdquo; was the optimistic rejoinder. &ldquo;If
I can keep sufficient enthusiasm in my body, I ought
to be able to carry it through perfectly.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-127" class="pagenum" title="127"></a>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be your <em>chef-d&rsquo;oeuvre</em>, I suppose,&rdquo; Breen
observed with his customary pleasantry.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; Nielsen admitted seriously. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
stronger than anything I&rsquo;ve done, I feel. It shows
maturity, I think, not only maturity of judgment, but
maturity of execution as well.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;In other words, Art,&rdquo; Breen interrupted slyly.
&ldquo;What more do you ask?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; confessed Nielsen, and his warm
smile appeared.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But what&rsquo;s the matter with the story?&rdquo; the
painter demanded.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How do you mean?&rdquo; the author retorted.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I thought <em>that</em> had fulfilled your ambition.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not quite, not quite,&rdquo; Nielsen hastened to deny,
and was thoughtful. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know just what it
was, but there was something missing in it,&rdquo; he said
gently, and changing the subject, concluded abruptly:
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I have that something in this essay.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Breen explained himself: &ldquo;You know what
made me ask about the story?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No. What?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I had lunch in a small bakery on Sixth Avenue
this noon.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Guess whom I saw there?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-128" class="pagenum" title="128"></a>
&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you guess?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Out with it!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Our old friend: Erna Vitek!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Nielsen turned and stared at his friend. He was
unable to speak.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What do you think o&rsquo; that?&rdquo; Breen pursued,
unruffled.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She must have left Allen.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And is working again?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Nielsen stared at the floor now. He seemed unable
to formulate, much less express, an opinion.
&ldquo;How is she? Changed?&rdquo; he requested at last.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Somewhat! She&rsquo;s quite a little harder and a
bit more quiet&mdash;that is the way matters appeared to
me. But her eyes have lost none of their boldness.
And besides, she seems to like it there.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She does?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, and she&rsquo;s very popular too.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How so?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The men are very attentive, it looked to me,&rdquo;
Breen volunteered significantly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And she?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s still got an eye open. Not as wide open,
<a id="page-129" class="pagenum" title="129"></a>
perhaps, as in the old days, but it isn&rsquo;t closed, that&rsquo;s
certain.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Nielsen was silent, reflecting.
</p>

<p>
At length, Breen asked: &ldquo;What do you imagine
will become of her?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I mean, of her life&mdash;what life do you suppose
she&rsquo;ll lead eventually: this young lady so moral,
unmoral or&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say exactly,&rdquo; Nielsen, who disliked the
topic, interrupted.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Think she&rsquo;ll take to the streets?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, no, not that!&rdquo; was the vehement denial.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Again, Nielsen seemed unable to answer, but
he boasted unexpectedly: &ldquo;She&rsquo;s too strong. She
has fight in her&mdash;and love of freedom.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But so have street ladies.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, but they don&rsquo;t carry it through.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; was the stubborn reply. &ldquo;They
don&rsquo;t, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, do you? Does Tom, Dick or Harry?
Does Erna?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Let&rsquo;s drop the subject.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<em>I</em> wouldn&rsquo;t be so certain that she does,&rdquo; Breen
insinuated, still persisting.
</p>

<p>

&ldquo;Of course, <em>you</em> wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Nielsen condemned,
unable longer to hold back his emotion. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
wisdom itself.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The young artist decided to shift the topic:
&ldquo;Heard from Carstairs lately?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Animation returned to Nielsen. &ldquo;Yes, I heard
from John last night.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is he still in Indianapolis?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, he has a fine position there and seems contented
now.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And Elsie Pearson?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;ll come off, as you said the other day.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Marriage?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good for John! I&rsquo;m glad he won. He was a
long time waiting.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Nelsen nodded. He was thoughtful once more.
But he shook off the mood and asked: &ldquo;What are
you doing, Breen?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Getting ready for spring.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so&mdash;spring&rsquo;ll be here in a week or two.
Going out to the country as usual?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve gathered a bunch of canvases and
plenty of tubes, etcetera, and off I&rsquo;ll go.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Going to Connecticut again?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s the only country for a landscape
painter.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-131" class="pagenum" title="131"></a>
&ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; Nielsen agreed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How about supper?&rdquo; Breen interposed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, what time is it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;After five o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;By Jove&mdash;that late? I must be getting dressed
soon.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Got an engagement?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m going to feed with the Plymptons.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Too bad! That means, I&rsquo;ll have to eat alone.
See you in the morning! So long!&rdquo; and Breen
moved away.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Going over to Landsmann&rsquo;s?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes. But it&rsquo;s hopelessly dull there these days.
It&rsquo;ll give me the incurables to-night.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Or a tummy-ache, at least,&rdquo; Nielsen added
good-humoredly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, so long!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So long!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Breen went out quietly and closed the door.
Nielsen studied the door with a blank expression.
But he shook himself and returned to his manuscript.
In a moment, he was absorbed, re-reading.

POETRY
</p>

<p class="ads">
A MAGAZINE OF VERSE
</p>

<p class="c">
Edited by Harriet Monroe, 543 Cass St., Chicago, Ill.
</p>

<p class="hang">
POETRY, at the end of its first year, is no longer an experiment
but an assured artistic success, a publication whose
importance is authoritatively recognized, not only in this
country, but in Great Britain and France as well. The
field it has opened up is full of brilliant possibilities, encouraging
the editors to hope for the enthusiastic support
of a discriminating public.
</p>

<p class="hang">
POETRY endeavors to present the best verse now being
written in English, quality alone being the test of acceptance.
</p>

<p class="hang">
POETRY is an effort to create an organ for the art. While
the ordinary magazines must minister to a large public
little interested in poetry, this magazine appeals to and
will develop a public primarily interested in poetry as
an art, potentially the highest, most complete human expression
of truth and beauty. Thus it offers to poets a
chance to be heard by their own audience, in their own
place, without the limitations imposed by the popular
magazines. And to lovers of poetry it offers each month
a sheaf of new verse in delicate form uninterrupted by
prose articles demanding a different mood.
